The updated guidelines comprise eight primary topics, in a question-and-answer format, that map a patient care journey from assessment to selection of evidence-based treatments, prevention of recurrence, and strategies for inadequate response. The guidelines adopt a personalized care approach that emphasizes shared decision-making that reflects the values, preferences, and treatment history of the patient with MDD (Major depressive disorder). Tables provide new and updated recommendations for psychological, pharmacological, lifestyle, complementary and alternative medicine, digital health, and neuromodulation treatments. Caveats and limitations of the evidence are highlighted.

Table A. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Criteria for Level of Evidence.

Row 0 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 1, Symbol: Full green-filled circle, Criteria: High-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size [b], preferably placebo-controlled.

Row 1 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 2, Symbol: 3/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.

Row 2 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 3, Symbol: 1/2 green-filled circle, Criteria: Small-sample [b] RCTs or nonrandomized, controlled prospective studies or high-quality retrospective studies.

Row 3 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 4, Symbol: 1/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Expert opinion/consensus.

Note. RCT (Randomized controlled trial) = randomized controlled trial.

[a] Note that Levels 1 and 2 evidence refer specifically to treatment studies in which randomized comparisons are available. Recommendations involving epidemiological data or risk factors primarily arise from observational studies, which are regarded as Level 3 evidence. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) often reflect judgment of the strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or Level 4 evidence.

[b] Adequate sample size defined as â‰¥30 participants per randomized condition; small-sample defined as <30 participants per randomized condition.

Table 2.4. Summary Recommendations for Lifestyle Interventions.


**First Line of Treatment**
	
	*   Supervised exercise (low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity
			*   **Level of evidence:** Level 1

	*   Light therapy (10,000 lux white light for 30 min daily) for MDEs with seasonal (winte) pattern.	
			*   **Level of evidence:** Level 1

**Second Line of Treatment**
	
	*   Light therapy for mild severity nonseasonal MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 2

	*   Adjunctive exercise for moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 2

	*   Adjunctive light therapy for moderate severity nonseasonal MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 2

	*   Adjunctive sleep hygiene and CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)-I.	
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 3

**Third Line of Treatment**
		
	*   Adjunctive healthy diet (varied diet with high content of fruit, vegetables, and fibre, and low	content of saturated fat and carbohydrates).
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 3

	*   Adjunctive Mediterranean diet.
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 3

	*   Adjunctive sleep deprivation (wake therapy).
		*   **Level of evidence:** Level 3	

**Insufficient evidence**	
	*   Probiotics.	
		*   **Level if evidence:** n/a	

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)-I = cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia.

  Text: Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 66
Regarding diet, many observational studies support the association of an unhealthy diet (high content of refined carbohydrates and saturated fat, and low content of fruits and vegetables, commonly called the Western diet) with increased prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms (Level 3) . In contrast, there are few interventional studies of diet manipulation. There is only 1 RCT (Randomized controlled trial) showing a modest effect of a Mediterranean-type diet in adults with MDD (Major depressive disorder), supporting a third-line recommendation (Level 3) ( Table 2.4 ). With regard to newer interventions such as probiotics, current evidence is equivocal, neither supporting nor refuting beneficial effects. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics in the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

#### Response by all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Embedder and LLama3.3 70B
- **Suggestion:** Supervised exercise 
- **Details:** Low to moderate intensity, 30-40 mins at a time, 3-4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks
- **Reasons:** According to the CANMAT guideline, supervised exercise is recommended as the first line of treatment for major depressive episodes of mild severity, with a Level 1 evidence rating, indicating high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.
