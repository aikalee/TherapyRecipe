Their reliability can be limited by methodological factors, including the scope of the review, the criteria used for study selection, and the heterogeneity, quality, and generalizability of included studies. In addition, most meta-analyses assess the “risk of bias” to consider how findings could be influenced by factors such as author allegiance and funding source and whether adequate measures have been taken to minimize potential sources of bias. Yet, even meta-analyses with a low risk of bias have limitations, as their results may still be biased by including lower-quality studies, differ depending on methodological decisions, and be inconsistent with high-quality trials. Consequently, selecting evidence to include in clinical guidelines involves quality assessment. Sometimes, a single large high-quality RCT may provide a better guide for evidence than a meta-analysis that includes studies of lower quality, higher bias, or greater heterogeneity.",

For example, studies comparing psychological treatments to minimal control conditions (such as waitlist) may not be as clinically relevant as studies that compare novel treatments to standard or usual care. Further, RCTs may have limited generalizability due to restrictive inclusion criteria. Accordingly, evidence from observational studies can complement controlled trials and is used where appropriate. Finally, while meta-analyses can track the evolution of evidence over time, it is recognized that early investigations of novel treatments tend to show larger effect sizes that decrease over subsequent years, particularly when the novel treatment becomes standard care. Given the rapid pace of research, CANMAT will review these guidelines again in 7 years (2030).",

For example, the 2013 Canadian Task Force for Preventative Health recommended against routine depression screening for adults with average risk, although this was graded as a weak recommendation because of low-quality evidence. The CANMAT 2016 guidelines recommended screening for individuals with risk factors when resources were available for further assessment and treatment. The United States Preventative Services Task Force recently updated its evidence review and concluded that routine depression screening is associated with moderate net benefit and improved outcomes after 6 to 12 months, particularly in settings that provide additional interventions for those who screen positive (Level 2). There are potential risks to routine screening, e.g., stigmatization, impact on occupational or insurance status, and unnecessary psychological and/or pharmacological treatment for false-positive screens, but the prevalence and impact of these risks have not been rigorously evaluated.",

These are classified as episode specifiers, based on cross-sectional symptoms of an MDE, and course specifiers, based on the longitudinal pattern of MDEs. Several episode specifiers (melancholic, atypical, psychotic, and catatonic features) are held over from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), while others (anxious distress and mixed features) are new in DSM-5-TR. Course specifiers include seasonal pattern (with primarily a winter pattern of MDEs) and peripartum onset. Specifiers are primarily useful for describing symptom and course patterns, with some utility for prognosis. However, they generally have limited value for selecting treatment (except for psychotic features and seasonal pattern, see Q.3.g and Q.3.m). Other clinical dimensions not identified in DSM-5-TR may be more useful for guiding treatment selection, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, somatic symptoms (e.g., pain, energy, and fatigue), and anhedonia (see Q.3.f).",

In DSM-5-TR, a chronic MDE (with full criteria) is classified as a specifier of persistent depressive disorder (PDD), which is characterized by 2 or more depressive symptoms that are present for more than 2 years. MDE in partial remission after treatment is a separate PDD specifier. PDD specifiers also include dysthymia, which is a chronic course of subthreshold depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for MDE. This conflation of chronic MDE, partial remission MDE, and dysthymia makes it difficult to differentiate specific treatments for PDD (see Q.3.f). Regardless, compared to individuals with episodic MDEs, those with PDD show lower response rates to standard treatments and less likelihood of achieving remission. Management for PDD should employ the DTD framework, with the focus of treatment centred on improving quality of life and functioning instead of symptom remission (Level 4) (see Q.7.b). ",

The most common barriers to care include costs of treatment, cultural beliefs, stigma, language barriers, fear of being judged by the care provider, unequal geographic distribution of services, and fragmented health services. Some approaches to help overcome these barriers and reduce the existing gap in access to services include screening programs, incorporating culturally competent and collaborative care, and using digital health interventions (DHIs) tailored for equity-deserving groups (<a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#table5-07067437241245384\">Table 1.2</a>).",

Evidence supports symptomatic remission as a realistic goal of acute phase treatment for most patients both in psychiatric and primary care settings.

Similarly, the relationship between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms may be bidirectional, with individuals using smoking to alleviate depressive symptoms (self-medication) while smoking, in turn, may increase susceptibility to depressive symptoms. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise or an increase in physical activity, a healthier diet, smoking cessation, and sleep hygiene are beneficial in MDEs (<a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#table9-07067437241245384\">Table 2.4</a>).",

While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD, with medium to large effects (Level 1). Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Tables 2.4 and 3.7).

There is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and depression, whereby sleep disturbances (insomnia and hypersomnia) are common symptoms of MDEs but disturbed sleep also increases the risk of developing MDD. Hence, restoring restful sleep is an important objective in MDD treatment and prevention. Although there is limited clinical trial evidence, instructing patients on sleep hygiene is likely beneficial (Level 4).

Patients usually enter at the least intensive “step” shown to be effective for their illness and move up or down depending on symptom progression or response. For example, people with mild severity MDEs may be appropriate for lower-intensity interventions while those with more severe and high-risk episodes are streamed to start with higher-intensity programs.

The severity of MDE does not predict outcomes in CBT versus pharmacotherapy; however, the combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment is more effective than either alone and should be considered in severe cases (see Q.3.b).

However, the relationship between the number of treatment sessions attended and the degree of therapeutic improvement remains unclear. Therefore, optimal doses of psychotherapy have been proposed based on the number of sessions in which at least 50% of patients respond to treatment, owing to the decreasing probability of improvement after this cut-off.

This conclusion, however, does not exclude the possibility that antidepressants may also increase suicidality in a subset of patients. Increased suicide risk may be associated with patient age and the time period of antidepressant use. When examining the risk of suicidal behaviour (death by suicide, attempted suicide, or preparatory acts), a meta-analysis of RCTs found that, compared with placebo, acute treatment with antidepressant medication is associated with increased risk among young adults below age 25, but with a decreased risk of suicidal behaviours among those aged 65 and older; in adults aged 25 to 65, there is no effect (Level 2). In contrast to these results, a meta-analysis of observational studies found a modest increase in suicidal behaviour associated with antidepressants that were not age-dependent (although there was no increase in a subanalysis of SSRIs only) (Level 3). Additionally, suicidal behaviour is noted to be highest in the month before antidepressant initiation (indicating that suicidality predates medication use), remains high in the month after antidepressant initiation, and then declines with continued use of antidepressants (Level 3). The month after discontinuing an antidepressant also is associated with an elevated risk of suicidal behaviour (Level 4). ",

While antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small proportion of patients may experience increased suicidal ideation when initiating antidepressants, especially young people. CANMAT recommends routine monitoring of suicide risk for all patients during antidepressant treatment, with enhanced attention during the first 4 weeks following a new antidepressant prescription and after stopping the medication (Level 3). With adolescent and young adult patients, in particular, clinicians should ensure that they are aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviours before initiating an antidepressant. Clinicians also should educate patients that if they experience an increase in suicidal thoughts when starting a new medication, they should (a) understand them as a medication side effect; (b) be aware that increasing suicidal thoughts indicate a need for urgent action to address distress and other symptoms; (c) implement a safety plan (see Q.2.c); and (d) reach out to their care provider, crisis line (e.g., call 9-8-8 in Canada and the USA), or an emergency department (Level 4).

Can Pharmacogenetic Testing Inform\nMedication Selection?119\nSeveral commercially available pharmacogenetic tests (also called pharmacogenomic tests) provide recommendations to inform the selection and dosing of antidepressants to reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions and increase the likelihood of positive responses. Currently, available tests are based on variants in genes that code for enzymes responsible for the metabolism of psychotropic medication, with some tests combining variants in genes coding for serotonin transporter and receptors. Meta-analyses show higher response and remission rates with pharmacogenetic testing compared to usual care, albeit with modest effect sizes, especially in absolute risk reductions (e.g., for response rates, ranging from 4.6 to 7.2 percentage points difference in favour of pharmacogenetic testing) (Level 2). Moreover, the RCTs included in the meta-analyses have significant risks of bias, primarily with a lack of blinding. Hence, CANMAT does not recommend the routine use of pharmacogenetic tests, because the clinical benefits are too modest and inconsistent to justify the delay in treatment associated with obtaining the test results (Level 2).

Few DHIs are rigorously evaluated for efficacy and safety. Privacy and security issues are often inadequately safeguarded. User engagement with DHIs decreases over time, e.g., less than one-third of individuals with depression are still using a DHI after 6 weeks. Access to DHIs may also be impeded by the “digital divide” or digital inequity factors, e.g., low digital literacy, inability to purchase a computer or mobile device, and lack of internet access. Hence, addressing the digital divide is important for people with MDD. Mental health clinicians also need training in digital literacy and how to assess, recommend, and use DHIs with their patients.",

For busy clinical settings, patient-rated scales (also called patient-rated outcome measures (PROMs)) are preferred because they are well-correlated with clinician-rated scales but take less time to administer. These PROMs can be supplemented by simple clinician-rated scales. Many are general scales that provide an overall severity measure, such as a total score. More detailed scales can be used to assess specific dimensions of depression, such as anhedonia, sleep, and cognition, when relevant. Some validated scales focus specifically on suicidal ideation and intent, with both clinician-rated (e.g., the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]) and patient-rated (e.g., the Suicide Scale) scales available. Some patients find it easier to endorse suicidal thoughts on a questionnaire than face to face with a health practitioner. However, while scales can help assess suicidal ideation, they cannot reliably predict suicide attempts or behaviours. When scales for suicide risk are used, the results should be promptly reviewed and followed up with a clinical assessment if scores indicate risk.",

Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.",

As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs.

Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe.

Few relapse prevention studies have systematically differentiated discontinuation symptoms from symptoms of recurrence, and fewer have investigated strategies for stopping antidepressants. A 2021 Cochrane review examined the effectiveness of different approaches to discontinuing long-term antidepressants, including abrupt discontinuation, and tapering the antidepressant with or without psychological support. There was no clear evidence to support abrupt or tapering schedules. There is low-quality evidence that providing psychological support (primarily CBT or MBCT) is beneficial while tapering. All these results had low certainty because of the methodological limitations of the included studies.

Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3). In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3). Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2). If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI and SNRI antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3).",

This definition has been criticized because it neglects psychological and neurostimulation treatments, it assumes that switching antidepressants is the preferred initial strategy and neglects add-on strategies. Furthermore, “failure” is often not defined or defined differently from study to study, and it does not account for partial response or residual symptoms.

In the academic literature, DTD is used to describe persistent depression that has failed numerous standard treatments (in contrast to the minimum of 2 antidepressants defined by TRD) and is further along the treatment trajectory. In addition, compared to the term TRD, patients find DTD to be a more supportive, hopeful, and collaborative term.

Several studies have shown that there is no difference in outcome between switching within a medication class and switching to a different class. Hence, when switching to another antidepressant, CANMAT recommends first selecting a first-line antidepressant with evidence for superior efficacy and a favourable tolerability profile (Level 4) (<a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#table14-07067437241245384\">Table 3.5</a>).

For most situations, given the low risk of drug interactions and side effects, the crossover “X” switch method can be used, i.e., slowly tapering the first medication while slowly titrating up the second (Level 4). If there is less urgency for a switch, or a history of problems with discontinuation symptoms (see Q.6), or to avoid conflating discontinuation symptoms from new side effects, the washout “V” method can be used, i.e., tapering and discontinuing the first medication before starting the second (Level 4). Switching to MAOIs requires at least 2 weeks’ washout from other serotonergic medications (5 weeks if switching from fluoxetine). Online tools are also available for advice on titration and switching schedules (e.g., SwitchRx.com).",

Rates of cardiac events and mortality associated with ECT are very low and similar to the risks for general anaesthesia. Adverse effects on cognition are of most concern, although modern ECT techniques, including unilateral electrode placement and refined electrical dosing, have reduced both the incidence and severity of cognitive side effects. Cognitive effects experienced immediately following an ECT session include transient disorientation, confusion, and memory lapses, particularly anterograde amnesia for events surrounding the treatment period. These effects typically resolve within days to weeks. While there is potential for long-term cognitive effects, particularly retrograde amnesia for events remote to ECT, recent meta-analyses of neuropsychological assessments demonstrate that cognitive performance is unchanged or improved at least 1 month after a course of ECT. Nevertheless, some patients report significant and distressing gaps in autobiographical memory long after ECT, and the discrepancy between cognitive performance and subjective memory dysfunction remains controversial. Of note is that subjective cognitive dysfunction is commonly experienced during an acute episode of MDD and is associated with persisting depressive symptoms.",

Unfortunately, there is only limited data to guide this treatment choice. Continuation ECT (administered at increasing intervals from once a week to once a month) shows better efficacy in preventing recurrence after ECT, compared to maintenance pharmacotherapy (Level 2). However, few medications have been systematically studied for maintenance pharmacotherapy. Lithium, when combined with either nortriptyline or venlafaxine-XR, is shown to be superior for relapse prevention compared to either antidepressant alone (Level 2).

The advantages of tDCS include inexpensive equipment and relative ease of use such that tDCS can be delivered at home with few side effects or safety concerns. Meta-analyses have shown that active tDCS is more effective than sham in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, especially when combined with an antidepressant (Level 2). However, the quality of evidence is significantly limited by heterogeneity in stimulation parameters and patient populations, high sham responses, and negative results from recent large RCTs. Current evidence also does not support the use of tDCS for those with severe depression or DTD (Level 2).",

Instead of direct electrical current, MST uses vertex or frontal placement of single or paired circular coils to deliver TMS. The high intensity and frequency of TMS induces an electrical field that is strong enough to elicit a generalized seizure. MST has shown promising results in small-sample RCTs, with similar efficacy to right unilateral, ultrabrief ECT, but fewer adverse effects. However, without more definitive studies, MST is still considered an investigational treatment (Level 3).",

Similarly, rTMS can be recommended as a first-choice treatment if there are tolerability concerns with medication options or if it was effective in a previous episode. Finally, except in emergent situations as mentioned above, rTMS should generally be considered before ECT, given its less invasive nature and that individuals may continue to work or attend school while undergoing rTMS.
