RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\naNote that Levels 1 and 2 evidence refer specifically to treatment studies in which randomized comparisons are available. Recommendations involving epidemiological data or risk factors primarily arise from observational studies, which are regarded as Level 3 evidence. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) often reflect judgment of the strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or Level 4 evidence.\n\nbAdequate sample size defined as \u226530 participants per randomized condition; small-sample defined as <30 participants per randomized condition.

These steps are:\n\n*   **Conduct a thorough assessment**\n    This step serves as the foundation for the entire process, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluation in clinical management.\n*   **Obtain collateral information**\n    Following the initial assessment, obtaining collateral information enables a more detailed understanding of the patient's condition.\n*   **Formulate a diagnosis & differential diagnosis**\n    With the gathered information, healthcare professionals formulate a diagnosis and consider alternative diagnoses to ensure accurate and comprehensive care.\n*   **Support education & self-management**\n    Effective support for patients' education and self-management is crucial for successful treatment outcomes.\n*   **Establish a therapeutic alliance**\n    Building a strong therapeutic alliance between healthcare providers and patients fosters trust and cooperation, leading to better health outcomes.\n*   **Construct a comprehensive safety & management plan**\n    A well-designed safety and management plan ensures the patient's safety and optimal management of their condition.\n*   **Deliver evidence-based treatments**\n    Evidence-based treatments are critical for delivering effective care, as they are grounded in scientific research and proven efficacy.\n*   **Use measurement-based care to monitor outcomes**\n    Monitoring outcomes through measurement-based care allows healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of treatments and make informed adjustments as needed.\n\nThe flowchart illustrates a cyclical process, where each step informs and builds upon the previous one, ensuring a holistic approach to clinical management. This structured approach enables healthcare professionals to provide high-quality, patient-centered care. (The first step is to conduct a thorough assessment of biological, psychological, and social factors, using collateral information when available, to formulate a diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Other management principles are discussed in subsequent questions (Q.2, Q.3, Q.5). Recommendations for principles of care are generally based on Level 3 and Level 4 evidence.)",

To extract and understand the process from the flowchart, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response**: This initial step considers various factors such as psychiatric and nonsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response, and pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing).\n\n2. **Optimize dose**: If a further specific dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range, this step aims to optimize the dose of the current antidepressant.\n\n3. **Consider adding psychological treatments**: If failure to achieve response or remission to initial treatment with an antidepressant, this step considers psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment.\n\n4. **Switch or adjunctive medication**: Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy, especially if there are tolerability issues with the initial antidepressant.\n\n5. **Add an adjunctive medication**: Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated, this step considers adding an adjunctive medication.\n\n6. **Consider adding neuromodulation treatments for TRD**: These are generally considered after one of the switch or adjunctive medication options. \n\n7. **First line**: Cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, behavioural activation.\n\n8. **Second line**: Cognitive-behavioural analysis of psychotherapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, problem-solving therapy, short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, trans-diagnostic psychological treatment.\n\n9. **Third line**: Acceptance and commitment therapy, long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, meta-cognitive therapy, motivational interviewing.\n\n10. **First line**: Ariipiprazole, brexpiprazole.\n\n11. **Second line**: Bupropion, IN e-s-ketamine/lY, lisdexamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, moclobemide, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.\n\n12. **Third line**: Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, nortVy azone-leterine, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe process flowchart outlines various steps to be taken when treating depression, starting from assessing factors that can interfere with treatment response, optimizing the dose of the current antidepressant, considering adding psychological treatments, switching or adding adjunctive medications, and considering neuromodulation treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Each step offers different options for managing depression, ranging from first-line treatments like cognitive-behavioural therapy and aripiprazole to third-line treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy and lithium. By following this flowchart, healthcare providers can tailor their approach to the individual needs of each patient, ensuring the most effective treatment strategy. (Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression).
