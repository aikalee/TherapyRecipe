Table A. CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence.

Row 0 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 1, Symbol: Full green-filled circle, Criteria: High-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size [b], preferably placebo-controlled.

Row 1 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 2, Symbol: 3/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.

Row 2 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 3, Symbol: 1/2 green-filled circle, Criteria: Small-sample [b] RCTs or nonrandomized, controlled prospective studies or high-quality retrospective studies.

Row 3 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 4, Symbol: 1/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Expert opinion/consensus.

Note. RCT = randomized controlled trial.

[a] Note that Levels 1 and 2 evidence refer specifically to treatment studies in which randomized comparisons are available. Recommendations involving epidemiological data or risk factors primarily arise from observational studies, which are regarded as Level 3 evidence. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) often reflect judgment of the strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or Level 4 evidence.

[b] Adequate sample size defined as ≥30 participants per randomized condition; small-sample defined as <30 participants per randomized condition.

Table 1.2. Recommendations[*] for Screening and Assessment

Summary recommendations for screening and assessment

* Carry a high index of suspicion for MDD in individuals with exposure to static nonmodifiable risk factors and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (Level 4).
* Screen for depression using a validated scale (e.g., PHQ-2 followed by the PHQ-9) in individuals with risk factors for depression, when there are supports and resources in place to follow up with full diagnostic assessment and treatment (Level 2).
* Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic assessment that addresses biological, psychological, and social factors while recognizing ethnocultural diversity, within a longitudinal life-course framework (Level 4).
* For equity-deserving groups in particular, use screening, culturally competent care, collaborative care, and digital health interventions to improve access to and quality of mental health care (Level 4).

[*]Recommendations for principles of care are generally based on Level 3 and Level 4 evidence. 
Note. MDD = major depressive disorder; PHQ = Patient Health Questionnaire.

Figure 1.1. Priciples of clinical assessment and management of major depressive disorder.

The image presents a flowchart illustrating the principles of clinical management. The flowchart is structured in a circular pattern, with each step building upon the previous one to form a cohesive process.

**Step 1: Conduct a thorough assessment**

**Step 2: Obtain collateral information**

**Step 3: Formulate a diagnosis and differential diagnosis**

**Step 4: Support education and self-management**

**Step 5: Establish a therapeutic alliance**

**Step 6: Construct a comprehensive safety and management plan**

**Step 7: Deliver evidence-based treatments**

**Step 8: Use measurement-based care to monitor outcomes**

**Step 9: Conduct a thorough assessment (again)**

The first step is to conduct a thorough assessment of biological, psychological, and social factors, using collateral information when available, to formulate a diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Other management principles are discussed in subsequent questions (Q.2, Q.3, Q.5). Recommendations for principles of care are generally based on Level 3 and Level 4 evidence.

Table 3.1. Summary Recommendations for Selecting the Initial Treatment. [1]

The table presents a summary of recommendations for initial treatment selection based on the severity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and the level of evidence supporting each recommendation. The table is divided into four sections, each representing a different level of evidence: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.

**Mild with low safety risk.**

	* Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy demonstrate similar benefits.
	* Psychotherapy (if readily accessible) is preferred because of fewer risks.
	* Exercise, certain CAM treatments, or guided DHIIs may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Moderate, with low-moderate safety risk.**

	* Initial choice is between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* Pharmacotherapy is slightly more efficacious in reducing depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during acute treatment.
	* Structured psychotherapy, specifically CBT, is slightly more efficacious in the medium-term (6–12 months).
	* Combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may be considered.
	* Exercise, certain CAM treatments and/or DHIIs may be considered as adjuncts to psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Severe, with moderate to high safety risk.**

	* For severe MDE without psychotic symptoms, use a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* For severe MDE with psychotic symptoms, use a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.
	* For very severe and/or life-threatening situations, consider electroconvulsive therapy.

Note. MDE = major depressive episode; CAM = complementary and alternative medicine; DHI = digital health intervention; CBT = cognitive-behavioural therapy. 
These recommendations are based on the severity of the illness (see conventions) and safety risk (see Q.2.c), but other factors should be considered, including treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability.
There is stronger evidence for the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy compared to exercise (Q.2.f), complementary and alternative medicine treatments (Q.3.m), and digital health interventions (Q.4.d).
[1] The level of evidence refers to the choice of treatment, not to the treatments themselves.

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Note. MDE = major disorder episode

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD = major depressive disorder; TCA = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.
