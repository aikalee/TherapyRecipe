                                                        Recommendations were organized by lines of treatment, which were

                                                    and choice of evidence-based treatment options. To this end, patient

                                                <p>The guidelines development process is similar to previous CANMAT
                                                    guidelines, with some exceptions. The familiar question–answer
                                                    format is retained because clinicians continue to affirm its
                                                    clinical practicality and ease of use. Questions were developed by a
                                                    core editorial group with feedback from patient partners and
                                                    organized into eight primary topics representing a patient care
                                                    journey from assessment to acute treatment and maintenance,
                                                    including treatment options for difficult-to-treat depression (DTD).
                                                    We also incorporated lifestyle interventions such as exercise,
                                                    nutrition, and sleep hygiene into treatment plans. The evidence
                                                    review process focused on meta-reviews of systematic reviews and
                                                    meta-analyses published since 2015 (the literature search end date

                                                    where possible. A rigorous method ensures consensus among the
                                                    editorial group, and new or controversial topics are highlighted to

                                                    <p>While systematic reviews and meta-analyses are useful for
                                                        summarizing data and are considered at the top of the evidence
                                                        hierarchy, they reflect the quality of the original studies they
                                                        synthesize. Their reliability can be limited by methodological
                                                        factors, including the scope of the review, the criteria used
                                                        for study selection, and the heterogeneity, quality, and
                                                        generalizability of included studies. In addition, most
                                                        meta-analyses assess the “risk of bias” to consider how findings
                                                        could be influenced by factors such as author allegiance and
                                                        funding source and whether adequate measures have been taken to
                                                        minimize potential sources of bias. Yet, even meta-analyses with
                                                        a low risk of bias have limitations, as their results may still
                                                        be biased by including lower-quality studies, differ depending
                                                        on methodological decisions, and be inconsistent with
                                                        high-quality trials. Consequently, selecting evidence to include
                                                        in clinical guidelines involves quality assessment. Sometimes, a
                                                        single large high-quality RCT may provide a better guide for
                                                        evidence than a meta-analysis that includes studies of lower
                                                        quality, higher bias, or greater heterogeneity.</p>
                                                    <p>Evaluation of many treatments and complex interventions also pose
                                                        challenges due to lack of blinding and choice of comparison
                                                        conditions. For example, studies comparing psychological
                                                        treatments to minimal control conditions (such as waitlist) may
                                                        not be as clinically relevant as studies that compare novel
                                                        treatments to standard or usual care. Further, RCTs may have
                                                        limited generalizability due to restrictive inclusion criteria.
                                                        Accordingly, evidence from observational studies can complement
                                                        controlled trials and is used where appropriate. Finally, while
                                                        meta-analyses can track the evolution of evidence over time, it
                                                        is recognized that early investigations of novel treatments tend
                                                        to show larger effect sizes that decrease over subsequent years,
                                                        particularly when the novel treatment becomes standard care.
                                                        Given the rapid pace of research, CANMAT will review these
                                                        guidelines again in 7 years (2030).</p>
                                                    <p>In summary, owing to the variability of individual patient cases
                                                        and limitations of the evidence base, few definitive or
                                                        universally preferred treatments apply to all patients.
                                                        Therefore, these CANMAT recommendations should be viewed as
                                                        guidance for clinicians to consider within the context of each
                                                        patient, rather than as established standards of care. Finally,
                                                        since the CANMAT guidelines have a global reach and the evidence
                                                        base is not country-specific, we note that some recommended
                                                        treatments are not available in Canada and that regulatory
                                                        requirements for medications vary from country to country.</p>

                                                        guidelines, the term <em>patient</em> refers to individuals with
                                                        MDD in clinical treatment. We use the terms <em>mild</em>,
                                                        <em>moderate</em>, and <em>severe</em> to describe the severity
                                                        of a major depressive episode (MDE), based on the rating of
                                                        symptom severity and degree of functional impairment, whichever
                                                        is higher. We recommend the use of a validated rating scale to
                                                        quantify these (see Q.5.a). As an example, an MDE of moderate
                                                        severity could represent either moderately severe symptoms with
                                                        mild–moderate functional impairment, or mild–moderate symptom
                                                        severity with moderate impairment.</p>
                                                    <p>Due to a lack of empirical differentiation between the terms
                                                        <em>relapse</em> and <em>recurrence</em>, we use them
                                                        interchangeably. We use the term <em>adjunctive</em> to refer to
                                                        adding a second medication or treatment to an initial one
                                                        (thereby replacing the term <em>augmentation</em>), whereas
                                                        <em>combination</em> refers to starting two medications or
                                                        treatments at the same time. <em>Sex</em> is used to denote
                                                        biological sex at birth and <em>gender</em> is used to denote
                                                        socially constructed roles, behaviours, and identities. Given
                                                        that psychiatric conditions have somatic symptoms and represent
                                                        a subset of all medical conditions, we use the term
                                                        <em>nonpsychiatric medical conditions</em> to denote such as
                                                        heart disease, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, etc.
                                                        Finally, we use text boxes to highlight new or controversial
                                                        topics. For example, <a href="#boxed-text1-07067437241245384"

                                                    2020, over 300 million individuals worldwide are estimated to be
                                                    living with MDD. Within Canada, MDD constitutes a significant public
                                                    health concern. The Canadian Community Health Survey found that ∼12%
                                                    of Canadians aged 12 and older reported a lifetime episode of MDD;
                                                    4.7% of Canadians experienced an MDE within the past year. Not only
                                                    is MDD highly prevalent, it results in social and occupational
                                                    impairment, diminished quality of life, and an elevated risk of

                                                    <p>Up to 60% of individuals with MDD are unrecognized or
                                                        misidentified in primary care settings, and rates of
                                                        under-detection are even higher in low- and middle-income
                                                        countries. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to
                                                        inform optimal strategies to improve detection and treatment
                                                        uptake. Routine screening refers to having all patients (or
                                                        at-risk groups) regularly complete screening procedures at
                                                        prespecified times/intervals.</p>
                                                    <p>Major extant guidelines provide conflicting recommendations
                                                        regarding routine screening for depression in adults who appear
                                                        at average risk (i.e., with no apparent symptoms of depression
                                                        or risk factors), in part because of inconsistent evidence to
                                                        support the benefits of screening and the challenges and costs
                                                        of implementation. For example, the 2013 Canadian Task Force for
                                                        Preventative Health recommended against routine depression
                                                        screening for adults with average risk, although this was graded
                                                        as a weak recommendation because of low-quality evidence. The
                                                        CANMAT 2016 guidelines recommended screening for individuals
                                                        with risk factors when resources were available for further
                                                        assessment and treatment. The United States Preventative
                                                        Services Task Force recently updated its evidence review and
                                                        concluded that routine depression screening is associated with
                                                        moderate net benefit and improved outcomes after 6 to 12 months,
                                                        particularly in settings that provide additional interventions
                                                        for those who screen positive <img class="inline"

                                                        screening. The 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2),
                                                        comprised of two items from the PHQ-9, is particularly useful in
                                                        primary care because of its brevity. The PHQ-2 asks about

                                                        (DSM-5-TR) includes subtypes within an MDE. These are classified
                                                        as episode specifiers, based on cross-sectional symptoms of an

                                                        psychotic, and catatonic features) are held over from the

                                                        (DSM-IV-TR), while others (anxious distress and mixed features)
                                                        are new in DSM-5-TR. Course specifiers include seasonal pattern

                                                        Specifiers are primarily useful for describing symptom and

                                                        energy, and fatigue), and anhedonia (see Q.3.f).</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, about 20% to 30% of individuals with MDEs have a chronic
                                                        course lasting more than 2 years. In DSM-5-TR, a chronic MDE
                                                        (with full criteria) is classified as a specifier of persistent
                                                        depressive disorder (PDD), which is characterized by 2 or more
                                                        depressive symptoms that are present for more than 2 years. MDE
                                                        in partial remission after treatment is a separate PDD
                                                        specifier. PDD specifiers also include dysthymia, which is a
                                                        chronic course of subthreshold depressive symptoms that do not
                                                        meet criteria for MDE. This conflation of chronic MDE, partial
                                                        remission MDE, and dysthymia makes it difficult to differentiate
                                                        specific treatments for PDD (see Q.3.f). Regardless, compared to
                                                        individuals with episodic MDEs, those with PDD show lower
                                                        response rates to standard treatments and less likelihood of
                                                        achieving remission. Management for PDD should employ the DTD
                                                        framework, with the focus of treatment centred on improving
                                                        quality of life and functioning instead of symptom remission

                                                        religious populations. There is also a recognized lack of access
                                                        and underutilization of mental health services for

                                                        include costs of treatment, cultural beliefs, stigma, language
                                                        barriers, fear of being judged by the care provider, unequal

                                                    </h3>
                                                    <p>Symptom remission remains a crucial clinical target for acute
                                                        treatment, as substantial evidence supports a lower risk of
                                                        relapse in those who achieve remission compared with those who
                                                        do not <img class="inline"

                                                        to achieve remission is associated with continuing symptom
                                                        burden and poor functional outcomes. Evidence supports
                                                        symptomatic remission as a realistic goal of acute phase
                                                        treatment for most patients both in psychiatric and primary care
                                                        settings. However, in defining remission and recovery, patients
                                                        often regard aspects of functioning and quality of life as more
                                                        important than the absence of symptoms. Hence, symptom
                                                        remission, while important, should be considered only an
                                                        intermediate objective for optimal treatment outcomes.</p>
                                                    <p>It is also worth noting that persistent depressive symptoms are
                                                        common even in individuals who otherwise achieve symptom
                                                        remission. These “residual” symptoms should be identified and
                                                        treated because persisting symptoms represent a major risk
                                                        factor for recurrence (see Q.6.c). Isolated, mild, and
                                                        intermittent symptoms can be treated using a symptom-targeted
                                                        approach with a focus on patient comfort and functionality
                                                        (e.g., using a short-term medication for insomnia).</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, some patients, such as those with PDD, may not achieve
                                                        symptom remission despite treatment with several evidence-based
                                                        approaches. For these patients with DTD, the therapeutic focus
                                                        should shift away from symptom remission towards prioritizing
                                                        the best possible improvement in functioning and quality of life
                                                        (see Q.7.b).</p>

                                                        about 15 deaths by suicide for every 100,000 males, compared to
                                                        about 5 deaths for every 100,000 females, representing over 4000
                                                        suicide deaths per year. Of those who die by suicide, about half
                                                        suffer from MDD, the most prevalent mental illness in these
                                                        individuals. Hence, assessing suicide risk and developing and
                                                        implementing a tailored safety plan are priorities for risk

                                                    <p>Patient preference plays a key role in depression management. SDM
                                                        helps establish a strong therapeutic alliance which facilitates
                                                        psychoeducation about critical aspects of the treatment,
                                                        including achieving symptom remission and promoting long-term
                                                        mental wellness. Clinicians should ensure that patients are
                                                        aware of the broad range of treatment options available for MDD,

                                                        alternative medicine (CAM) treatments. Clinicians also should
                                                        explain how treatments work and dispel myths and stigma (e.g.,

                                                    <p>Discussions with patients should also acknowledge the local
                                                        realities of the healthcare ecosystem, including any limitations

                                                        treatments. Moreover, every effort should be made to provide
                                                        treatments preferred by patients. Given the many evidence-based
                                                        options, it is advisable for clinicians and patients to agree

                                                        alternative options so that patients can select and adhere to
                                                        the care plan that aligns with their values and needs.</p>

                                                        to the decision-making process. Meta-analyses find that, while
                                                        SDM may not significantly improve treatment adherence or symptom
                                                        change, it increases patient knowledge, communication, and
                                                        satisfaction. CANMAT recommends introducing elements of SDM to

                                                        settings, but cost may be a significant barrier for many
                                                        patients. Cost may also play a role in medication treatments,
                                                        given that, in general, newer medications are more expensive

                                                        both developing MDD and worsening symptom severity. For

                                                        relationship between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms
                                                        may be bidirectional, with individuals using smoking to
                                                        alleviate depressive symptoms (self-medication) while smoking,
                                                        in turn, may increase susceptibility to depressive symptoms.

                                                    </h3>
                                                    <p>Several service delivery models have evidence of benefit for the
                                                        management of MDD, including stepped care, stratified care, and
                                                        collaborative care. Each of these models emphasizes
                                                        evidence-based treatments, but the mode of treatment selection
                                                        and delivery differs for each framework. Regardless of the
                                                        model, when 2 or more clinicians are involved in a patient's
                                                        care, ensuring timely and effective communication is essential
                                                        to maintain continuity of care.</p>
                                                    <p>Stepped-care delivery refers to a care model in which patients
                                                        access sequential treatments of increasing intensity as needed,
                                                        according to prespecified criteria such as severity of illness.
                                                        Patients usually enter at the least intensive “step” shown to be
                                                        effective for their illness and move up or down depending on
                                                        symptom progression or response. For example, people with mild
                                                        severity MDEs may be appropriate for lower-intensity
                                                        interventions while those with more severe and high-risk
                                                        episodes are streamed to start with higher-intensity programs.
                                                        In contrast to stepped care, stratified care refers to models in
                                                        which patients are initially matched to receive treatments
                                                        customized to both the severity and complexity of their needs.
                                                        Both models are efficacious and cost-effective in managing

                                                        evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar
                                                        efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a
                                                        first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the
                                                        preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity,
                                                        monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Q.3.m) treatments and

                                                        by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy
                                                        and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to

                                                        initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and
                                                        antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the
                                                        most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy <img

                                                        two is less straightforward and depends on context,
                                                        availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies
                                                        and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective
                                                        in treating MDD in the short term. Antidepressants may be
                                                        slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed

                                                        during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy
                                                        (specifically, CBT), is more efficacious than antidepressants at
                                                        6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant
                                                        medication and psychotherapy should also be considered <img

                                                    <p>Combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more
                                                        effective than either alone for acute treatment; combined

                                                        The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (including
                                                        mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT]) initiated

                                                        treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that
                                                        remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of

                                                        treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued
                                                        or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen
                                                        when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological

                                                        difficult to interpret due to methodological challenges,
                                                        including lack of blinding and the effects of allegiance to a
                                                        particular model. A network meta-analysis ranked CBT, IPT, and
                                                        BA as the top psychotherapies based on outcome measures
                                                        reflecting treatment response and acceptability. Other

                                                        Q.3.f).</p>
                                                    <p>Psychotherapy is similarly effective across most demographic
                                                        factors, including sex, age, level of education, culture, and
                                                        ethnicity, hence these patient factors are not informative for
                                                        choosing the initial psychotherapy. As for clinical factors,
                                                        illness severity primarily affects the urgency with which the
                                                        treatment must begin; the more severe the illness, the more
                                                        imperative it is to start treatment as soon as possible to avert
                                                        the risk of harm. The severity of MDE does not predict outcomes
                                                        in CBT versus pharmacotherapy; however, the combination of
                                                        psychological and pharmacological treatment is more effective
                                                        than either alone and should be considered in severe cases (see
                                                        Q.3.b). Importantly, meta-analytic evidence suggests that CBT
                                                        reduces suicide attempts by half in those who attempted suicide
                                                        in the previous 6 months; therefore, the addition or initiation
                                                        of CBT may be considered for people with a recent history of a

                                                    <p>Most improvement occurs during the early sessions of

                                                        However, the relationship between the number of treatment

                                                        remains unclear. Therefore, optimal doses of psychotherapy have
                                                        been proposed based on the number of sessions in which at least

                                                        probability of improvement after this cut-off. The strongest
                                                        evidence suggests that an optimal dose for a first-line

                                                            bupropion, was approved in 2022 in the United States of

                                                            trials showing an advantage over placebo and low-dose
                                                            bupropion alone. Dextromethorphan is a glutamate

                                                    <p>In the CANMAT 2016 guidelines, the DSM-5-TR episode specifiers,
                                                        melancholic features and atypical features, were not associated
                                                        with specific treatment recommendations. Other specifiers had
                                                        limited evidence for specific treatments, such as

                                                        features, and combination antidepressant and antipsychotic
                                                        treatment, or ECT, for psychotic features. There is no new

                                                        distress, has a prognostic value in that MDE with anxiety is

                                                        there is no evidence for better responses with any specific
                                                        medication, hence all first-line antidepressants are recommended

                                                            Anhedonia is reported by up to 70% of patients with MDD and

                                                            may be an indicator of dopaminergic dysfunction. A

                                                        an Increased Risk of Suicide?</h3>
                                                    <p>Collectively, evidence supports the conclusion that
                                                        antidepressants reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviours, with a
                                                        greater effect on suicidal ideation than on prevention of

                                                        however, does not exclude the possibility that antidepressants
                                                        may also increase suicidality in a subset of patients. Increased
                                                        suicide risk may be associated with patient age and the time
                                                        period of antidepressant use. When examining the risk of
                                                        suicidal behaviour (death by suicide, attempted suicide, or
                                                        preparatory acts), a meta-analysis of RCTs found that, compared

                                                        associated with increased risk among young adults below age 25,
                                                        but with a decreased risk of suicidal behaviours among those
                                                        aged 65 and older; in adults aged 25 to 65, there is no effect

                                                        antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small
                                                        proportion of patients may experience increased suicidal

                                                    <p>SSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures
                                                        and falls, particularly in older adults. Most SSRIs have few

                                                        pharmacogenomic tests) provide recommendations to inform the
                                                        selection and dosing of antidepressants to reduce the likelihood
                                                        of adverse reactions and increase the likelihood of positive
                                                        responses. Currently, available tests are based on variants in
                                                        genes that code for enzymes responsible for the metabolism of
                                                        psychotropic medication, with some tests combining variants in
                                                        genes coding for serotonin transporter and receptors.
                                                        Meta-analyses show higher response and remission rates with
                                                        pharmacogenetic testing compared to usual care, albeit with
                                                        modest effect sizes, especially in absolute risk reductions
                                                        (e.g., for response rates, ranging from 4.6 to 7.2 percentage
                                                        points difference in favour of pharmacogenetic testing) <img

                                                        included in the meta-analyses have significant risks of bias,
                                                        primarily with a lack of blinding. Hence, CANMAT does not
                                                        recommend the routine use of pharmacogenetic tests, because the
                                                        clinical benefits are too modest and inconsistent to justify the
                                                        delay in treatment associated with obtaining the test results

                                                            superior efficacy in TRD and may have specificity for

                                                        Medicine Treatments are Effective?</h3>
                                                    <p>CAM treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here
                                                        we provide recommendations for using the CAM treatments that
                                                        have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the
                                                        CANMAT 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical
                                                        guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM treatment has
                                                        reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a
                                                        first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for
                                                        moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in
                                                        the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM treatments. CANMAT
                                                        therefore recommends the consideration of CAM treatments alone
                                                        only for MDE of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM
                                                        treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in

                                                        serotonin syndrome. In addition, St. John's wort is a potent CYP

                                                        found the efficacy of saffron for reducing depressive symptoms

                                                        and many medical conditions underscores the importance of
                                                        recognizing and treating comorbidities with MDD.</p>
                                                    <p>A review of treatment for specific comorbid conditions is beyond
                                                        the scope of these guidelines. Generally, the presence of a
                                                        comorbid condition makes MDD more difficult to treat, and
                                                        depressive symptoms may be conflated with symptoms of the other
                                                        condition. Similarly, it may be difficult to distinguish the
                                                        side effects of depression treatment from the side effects of
                                                        concomitant medications. It is important to minimize
                                                        polypharmacy and check for drug interactions with concomitant
                                                        medications to avoid iatrogenic adverse effects. The choice of
                                                        pharmacotherapy should also consider medication side effect
                                                        profiles that do not worsen comorbid conditions.</p>

                                                        purposes, including disease screening, monitoring, treatment,
                                                        and preventing recurrence. The term also encompasses wearables
                                                        such as activity trackers, digital phenotyping, text or SMS

                                                        guideline, we use the term, DHIs, to denote internet programs or
                                                        mobile apps that deliver depression treatment.</p>
                                                    <p>Many DHIs provide tools to promote depression self-management,
                                                        drawing on evidence-based psychotherapies such as CBT, BA, and
                                                        mindfulness. Some DHIs specifically address MDD and are designed
                                                        to supplement clinical care while others aim to be a substitute
                                                        for in-person care. Other DHIs target nonspecific
                                                        depression/anxiety symptoms, stress, or burnout, which may
                                                        indirectly benefit MDD. DHIs are potentially useful for
                                                        individuals with mild to moderate severity of depressive
                                                        symptoms; however, symptoms of severe depression, such as poor
                                                        motivation and cognitive dysfunction, may interfere with an
                                                        individual's ability to use DHIs.</p>
                                                    <p>The potential advantages of DHIs include access to treatment at
                                                        times and places that are convenient for the user, provision of
                                                        feedback to the user in real-time, and customization of
                                                        interventions for specific populations and in different
                                                        languages, e.g., children and youth, people with nonpsychiatric
                                                        medical conditions, postpartum users, ethnocultural groups, etc.
                                                        Hence, DHIs may offer a resource that can complement and build a

                                                    <p>However, the clinical use of DHIs also poses many challenges. Few

                                                        and security issues are often inadequately safeguarded. User
                                                        engagement with DHIs decreases over time, e.g., less than
                                                        one-third of individuals with depression are still using a DHI
                                                        after 6 weeks. Access to DHIs may also be impeded by the
                                                        “digital divide” or digital inequity factors, e.g., low digital
                                                        literacy, inability to purchase a computer or mobile device, and
                                                        lack of internet access. Hence, addressing the digital divide is
                                                        important for people with MDD. Mental health clinicians also

                                                        Evaluating DHIs?</h3>
                                                    <p>Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to
                                                        support their mental health care but they often face challenges
                                                        when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs.
                                                        Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by
                                                        internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize
                                                        popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy,
                                                        safety, privacy, and security of personal health information.
                                                        Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility,
                                                        but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation.
                                                        While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of
                                                        commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are

                                                        the most important consideration. However, of the tens of

                                                        informative, e.g., observational studies, studies in nonclinical

                                                        often shared with or sold to third parties. DHIs are more likely
                                                        to be trustworthy if they have a clear privacy policy, guarantee
                                                        to keep data anonymous, offer data security measures including
                                                        password protection, explicitly state they will not sell data to

                                                        collection entirely. Other privacy risks should also be
                                                        considered, e.g., risk of unwanted disclosure if a mobile app
                                                        has a diagnosis in its title. Clinicians should also consult

                                                        DHIs, especially in vulnerable individuals. For example, daily
                                                        mood monitoring and reminders for depression management may

                                                        diagnosis. DHIs should include clear procedures to follow when

                                                        as the exchange of inaccurate or harmful information,
                                                        interpersonal conflict, and unwanted disclosure of personal
                                                        information. Some of these risks can be mitigated by features
                                                        including therapist moderation of support groups, peer-developed
                                                        content that can be reviewed for accuracy, and the ability to
                                                        participate anonymously if desired.</p>
                                                    <p>Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects,
                                                        particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy
                                                        issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have
                                                        additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or
                                                        therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during
                                                        a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can
                                                        reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about
                                                        compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about
                                                        the current use of other apps to identify features which may
                                                        support DHI use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social
                                                        networking integration). Sharing data with a health care
                                                        provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense
                                                        of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any
                                                        adverse events.</p>
                                                    <p>Clinicians and patients can also utilize standardized frameworks
                                                        for DHI evaluation. The nonprofit website Mindtools.io offers
                                                        star-rating app reviews using the Enlight scale, which considers
                                                        content and user engagement. The Division of Digital Psychiatry

                                                        users to evaluate apps providing specific features for their

                                                    <p>Unguided (i.e., self-directed) DHIs are programs in which the
                                                        user engages independently, without help or contact with another
                                                        person, whereas guided (or facilitated) DHIs are those where an
                                                        individual supports the user to guide them through the program.
                                                        Guides may be clinically trained (e.g., a CBT therapist) or
                                                        equipped with technical knowledge of the DHI to encourage the
                                                        user to complete the program (e.g., a lay coach or peer support
                                                        person). Guidance can be synchronous (advice is given by the
                                                        guide in real-time while the participant is using the DHI) or
                                                        asynchronous (advice is provided when it is convenient for the
                                                        guide to respond, e.g., by email or text). In some cases,
                                                        guidance involves specific feedback on a user's responses to
                                                        homework (e.g., a thought record) generated by the DHI. Guides
                                                        are often helpful to motivate individuals to use and complete
                                                        the program, thereby enhancing efficacy.</p>
                                                    <p>In studies that compare self-directed and guided DHIs, all types
                                                        of interventions are commonly grouped within a single guidance
                                                        category of “guided” or “unguided.” This limitation conflates
                                                        the efficacy of guided versus unguided DHIs with potential
                                                        differences in efficacy within each group. Nonetheless, in these
                                                        studies, guided DHIs are generally more effective than

                                                        and has subsequently added numerous interactive exercises and

                                                        versus control conditions, but there was no significant effect
                                                        in the 2 RCTs involving participants with a diagnosis of MDD.
                                                        Given the low level of evidence, CANMAT does not recommend

                                                        human conversation. These conversational agents, known as

                                                        responses that are generated by AI algorithms. Chatbots
                                                        potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of

                                                    </h3>
                                                    <p>MBC is an evidence-based practice that uses routine outcome
                                                        measurement and feedback to guide clinical decisions.
                                                        Practically, MBC in psychiatry comprises 3 components: (a)
                                                        regularly using validated outcome scales during patient
                                                        encounters; (b) reviewing the scale scores with patients; and
                                                        (c) using the scale scores alongside clinical assessment to
                                                        support collaborative decision-making.</p>
                                                    <p>Several high-quality trials and systematic reviews show that MBC
                                                        improves medication adherence and outcomes, especially in the
                                                        pharmacological treatment of MDD <img class="inline"

                                                        with psychotherapy, although many of the supporting studies
                                                        involve mixed-diagnosis outpatient samples and use more general
                                                        outcome measures, such as the outcome questionnaire. In these
                                                        studies, MBC was associated with enhanced patient engagement,
                                                        higher intervention accuracy, and shorter treatment duration

                                                        identify nonresponders who might need additional therapeutic
                                                        techniques or sessions, or who would benefit from alternative
                                                        treatments. Across treatment modalities, MBC can enhance the
                                                        therapeutic alliance and facilitate SDM. Patients become active
                                                        participants in monitoring their treatment, which helps them
                                                        relate collaboratively with their care providers. For these
                                                        reasons, the use of MBC is recommended in the management of MDD

                                                        clinician-rated scales but take less time to administer. These
                                                        PROMs can be supplemented by simple clinician-rated scales. Many
                                                        are general scales that provide an overall severity measure,
                                                        such as a total score. More detailed scales can be used to
                                                        assess specific dimensions of depression, such as anhedonia,
                                                        sleep, and cognition, when relevant. Some validated scales focus
                                                        specifically on suicidal ideation and intent, with both
                                                        clinician-rated (e.g., the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
                                                        Scale [C-SSRS]) and patient-rated (e.g., the Suicide Scale)
                                                        scales available. Some patients find it easier to endorse
                                                        suicidal thoughts on a questionnaire than face to face with a
                                                        health practitioner. However, while scales can help assess
                                                        suicidal ideation, they cannot reliably predict suicide attempts
                                                        or behaviours. When scales for suicide risk are used, the
                                                        results should be promptly reviewed and followed up with a
                                                        clinical assessment if scores indicate risk.</p>

                                                    <p>The use of scales for MBC is similar to the use of laboratory
                                                        tests in that the results must be considered within the context
                                                        of clinical assessment and care. There are many reasons why
                                                        scale scores may not reflect a patient's clinical state. For
                                                        example, the negative cognitive bias associated with MDD may
                                                        interfere with accurate self-report, or some personality traits
                                                        may contribute to chronic overreporting or underreporting on a
                                                        symptom scale. Patients may also be concerned about
                                                        over-reliance on a number and not their more complex issues.</p>
                                                    <p>While MBC is largely intended to increase clinical objectivity,
                                                        it can also provide insight into patients’ subjective
                                                        experiences. For example, when clinical evaluation varies
                                                        substantially from patients’ symptom reporting, clinicians can
                                                        use the discrepancies to explore individual factors that can
                                                        colour patients’ perceptions about symptoms. These discussions
                                                        are likely to inform about patients’ cognitive schemas and can
                                                        enhance therapeutic rapport. Hence, scales should complement,
                                                        not replace, the clinical interview and the clinician's
                                                        comprehensive understanding of the patient.</p>
                                                    <p>MBC is also an integral component of collaborative care, where it
                                                        serves as an essential means to communicate about a patient's
                                                        clinical status and progress within the treatment team. MBC
                                                        provides assessment continuity in settings where different
                                                        providers manage the patient's care, e.g., when patients see
                                                        different physicians at a clinic or where different providers
                                                        manage medications and psychotherapy.</p>

                                                    <p>Incorporating scales into clinical management can help detect
                                                        early improvement, clinically significant change, and symptom
                                                        remission. Furthermore, MBC can identify cases when patients are
                                                        not responding adequately to treatment. Studies show that
                                                        clinicians and patients may not always recognize a lack of
                                                        response or remission, highlighting the limitations of relying
                                                        on general impressions.</p>
                                                    <p>Scales can be used to operationalize the definitions for
                                                        improvement, response, and remission (discussed in Q.2). Early
                                                        improvement is often defined with a symptom scale as a reduction
                                                        in score of 20% or greater from baseline (within 2 to 4 weeks
                                                        after treatment initiation), whereas response is defined as 50%
                                                        or greater improvement from baseline. Symptom remission is
                                                        indicated by a specific threshold score for each scale, e.g., a
                                                        score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
                                                        (HAM-D), 10 or less on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
                                                        Scale (MADRS), and 4 or less on the PHQ-9. Some definitions of
                                                        remission also specify a minimum duration, e.g., the DSM-5
                                                        defines remission as the absence or near absence of symptoms for
                                                        at least 2 months.</p>
                                                    <p>MBC can be integrated into medication algorithms, with scale
                                                        scores supporting clinical assessment and judgement for
                                                        treatment decisions. For instance, lack of early improvement
                                                        (i.e., less than 20% reduction in symptom scores at 2 to 4
                                                        weeks) after initiating an antidepressant is strongly associated
                                                        with nonresponse and nonremission at later time points. Hence, a
                                                        lack of early improvement by 4 weeks would trigger consideration
                                                        of increasing the dose or switching the medication <img

                                                    <p>While the total score on a scale is a useful proxy for overall
                                                        severity, individual item scores may also be informative. For
                                                        example, a total score of 4 on the PHQ-9 may indicate symptom
                                                        remission, but a rating of 3 on the insomnia item suggests that
                                                        residual sleep issues should be addressed. By examining both
                                                        total and individual item scores, clinicians can comprehensively
                                                        assess symptom profiles and tailor treatments accordingly.</p>
                                                    <p>The concept of recovery extends beyond symptom relief to include
                                                        functional outcomes and quality of life. While there are few
                                                        consensus definitions of response or remission in terms of

                                                        many barriers still exist to limit the widespread adoption of
                                                        MBC in clinical practice. Clinicians often feel that using MBC
                                                        takes too much time and that discussing scales with patients
                                                        takes time away from the clinical encounter. Clinicians also may
                                                        perceive that scales do not capture important aspects of a

                                                        in clinical settings include using simple PROMs that are free of
                                                        charge, emailing scales to patients to complete prior to their
                                                        appointment, and having patients complete scales in the waiting
                                                        room before the appointment. Mobile and internet apps are also
                                                        available that allow patients to complete validated scales and
                                                        track their scores on their own time. For example, Apple has
                                                        integrated the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 into its Health mobile app, so
                                                        that scores can be tracked alongside other health indicators.

                                                    <p>Scales for MBC can be helpful when administered every 2 to 4
                                                        weeks during the acute phase of treatment when active treatment
                                                        decisions are being made. During the maintenance phase or
                                                        chronic states of MDD, scales can be used less frequently so
                                                        that patients do not become frustrated with repeated testing and
                                                        scores that may not change. A key component of MBC involves
                                                        longitudinally tracking scores from scales and questionnaires.
                                                        The simplest approach is to document the total scores in the
                                                        progress notes during each visit. Electronic medical records
                                                        (EMRs) can be modified to track scores over time in the same way
                                                        as laboratory results. Internet-based and mobile solutions for
                                                        MBC are also available for clinical settings that do not have
                                                        EMRs or where EMRs cannot be easily reconfigured.</p>

                                                    <p>The 2016 CANMAT guidelines recommended that patients maintain
                                                        treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving
                                                        symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests
                                                        that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after
                                                        remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months <img

                                                    <p>Maintenance psychotherapy can also prevent relapse and
                                                        recurrence. Several meta-analyses and a network meta-analysis
                                                        show that various psychological treatments (CBT, MBCT, IPT,
                                                        CBASP, and PST) are superior to control conditions at preventing
                                                        depressive relapse, with comparable effects among the different

                                                        the use of booster sessions at regular intervals (e.g., 4
                                                        sessions over 12 months) as an effective strategy for relapse
                                                        prevention with MBCT. Psychotherapy appears to be as effective
                                                        as antidepressants for preventing recurrence and may confer
                                                        longer-lasting benefits by helping patients acquire more
                                                        adaptive coping strategies over time. As a result, psychological
                                                        interventions should be considered as first-choice options for
                                                        mild to moderate severity MDD.</p>
                                                    <p>The sequential treatment model consists of adding or switching to
                                                        psychotherapy in the maintenance phase, after a response to
                                                        acute phase pharmacotherapy. Sequential treatment also has
                                                        meta-analytic evidence for the prevention of recurrence, even
                                                        when antidepressants are stopped. Adding psychotherapy (with CBT
                                                        and its variations the best studied) also offers the benefits of
                                                        treating residual symptoms and increasing psychological
                                                        well-being and resilience. Pharmacotherapy and sequential
                                                        treatment with psychotherapy are recommended especially for
                                                        individuals with recurrent and severe MDEs, who carry a high
                                                        risk of recurrence with monotherapy. For these cases,
                                                        pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychotherapy

                                                        and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A

                                                        abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like

                                                        generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or

                                                        <p>It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the

                                                            result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin
                                                            transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe
                                                            withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the
                                                            dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose
                                                            reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed
                                                            percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor
                                                            occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is
                                                            extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission

                                                            presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on

                                                    <p>It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from
                                                        early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent
                                                        symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily.
                                                        Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within
                                                        days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic
                                                        symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations)
                                                        that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and
                                                        improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level.
                                                        Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent
                                                        discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently
                                                        compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological
                                                        support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation.
                                                        Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication
                                                        without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate
                                                        discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.</p>
                                                    <p>However, there is no consensus on the best strategy for stopping
                                                        antidepressants. Few relapse prevention studies have
                                                        systematically differentiated discontinuation symptoms from
                                                        symptoms of recurrence, and fewer have investigated strategies
                                                        for stopping antidepressants. A 2021 Cochrane review examined
                                                        the effectiveness of different approaches to discontinuing
                                                        long-term antidepressants, including abrupt discontinuation, and
                                                        tapering the antidepressant with or without psychological
                                                        support. There was no clear evidence to support abrupt or
                                                        tapering schedules. There is low-quality evidence that providing
                                                        psychological support (primarily CBT or MBCT) is beneficial
                                                        while tapering. All these results had low certainty because of
                                                        the methodological limitations of the included studies. A

                                                        after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third
                                                        attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters
                                                        who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach
                                                        remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are
                                                        higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with
                                                        antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate

                                                        poor treatment response include anxiety disorders, ADHD,

                                                        Hence, regular reassessment is important for patients with

                                                        a therapeutic dose and adequate duration. This definition has
                                                        been criticized because it neglects psychological and
                                                        neurostimulation treatments, it assumes that switching
                                                        antidepressants is the preferred initial strategy and neglects
                                                        add-on strategies. Furthermore, “failure” is often not defined
                                                        or defined differently from study to study, and it does not
                                                        account for partial response or residual symptoms. Additionally,
                                                        the term “resistant” has a negative connotation which suggests
                                                        futility and may discourage patients and clinicians from further

                                                    <p>DTD is a term proposed to extend the TRD concept and to better
                                                        characterize the collaborative journey of patients and their
                                                        clinicians when standard treatments have not been effective. In
                                                        the DTD model, the therapeutic focus shifts away from symptom
                                                        remission towards symptom management, to achieve the best
                                                        possible improvement in patient-prioritized outcomes such as
                                                        functioning and quality of life. In the academic literature, DTD
                                                        is used to describe persistent depression that has failed
                                                        numerous standard treatments (in contrast to the minimum of 2
                                                        antidepressants defined by TRD) and is further along the
                                                        treatment trajectory. In addition, compared to the term TRD,
                                                        patients find DTD to be a more supportive, hopeful, and
                                                        collaborative term. Hence, in these guidelines, we will use DTD
                                                        as a holistic framework when discussing unsatisfactory responses
                                                        to standard treatments and typically defined TRD when discussing
                                                        medication options or studies that use the term.</p>

                                                        Switching should be considered first when there is no response

                                                    <p>Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in

                                                        starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably,
                                                        if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low
                                                        likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that
                                                        point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to
                                                        switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

                                                        that there is no difference in outcome between switching within

                                                    <p>Adding an adjunctive agent retains partial treatment gains from
                                                        the initial antidepressant, avoids discontinuation symptoms from
                                                        stopping the first medication, and potentially adds
                                                        complementary mechanisms of action that have a faster onset of
                                                        response. These benefits are especially helpful when there has

                                                        well tolerated. Adding another medication may also target
                                                        specific residual symptoms or side effects from the initial

                                                        adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and
                                                        potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If
                                                        pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in

                                                        is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific

                                                        (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present);
                                                        there is, however, little evidence available to support this
                                                        strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive
                                                        treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by
                                                        reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with

                                                            Hence, both efficacy and tolerability should be considered

                                                            uses vertex or frontal placement of single or paired

                                                            frequency of TMS induces an electrical field that is strong
                                                            enough to elicit a generalized seizure. MST has shown

                                                    <p>In some clinical situations, noninvasive neuromodulation
                                                        treatments can be considered as first-choice treatments for MDD.
                                                        For example, ECT can be used as first-line treatment in severe
                                                        illness (e.g., MDE with psychotic or catatonic features, severe
                                                        suicidal ideation, and deteriorating physical condition) or for
                                                        patients who had a prior good response to ECT. Similarly, rTMS
                                                        can be recommended as a first-choice treatment if there are
                                                        tolerability concerns with medication options or if it was
                                                        effective in a previous episode. Finally, except in emergent
                                                        situations as mentioned above, rTMS should generally be
                                                        considered before ECT, given its less invasive nature and that
                                                        individuals may continue to work or attend school while
                                                        undergoing rTMS. Although some studies show that prior poor
                                                        response to ECT is associated with poor response to rTMS, other
                                                        studies do not.</p>
                                                    <p>Given the lower level of evidence for efficacy and the greater
                                                        associated risks, surgical neuromodulation treatments should
                                                        generally be considered after noninvasive neuromodulation
                                                        treatments. Currently, VNS is the only surgical neuromodulation
                                                        treatment approved for TRD by regulatory agencies and is
                                                        recommended as a third-line option (<a
