        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Background</h3>
        <p>The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) last published clinical guidelines for the
            management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2016. Owing to advances in the field, an update was needed
            to incorporate new evidence and provide new and revised recommendations for the assessment and management of
            MDD in adults.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec2">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Methods</h3>
        <p>CANMAT convened a guidelines editorial group comprised of academic clinicians and patient partners. A
            systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since
            the 2016 guidelines. Recommendations were organized by lines of treatment, which were informed by
            CANMAT-defined levels of evidence and supplemented by clinical support (consisting of expert consensus on
            safety, tolerability, and feasibility). Drafts were revised based on review by patient partners, expert peer
            review, and a defined expert consensus process.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec3">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Results</h3>
        <p>The updated guidelines comprise eight primary topics, in a question-and-answer format, that map a patient
            care journey from assessment to selection of evidence-based treatments, prevention of recurrence, and
            strategies for inadequate response. The guidelines adopt a personalized care approach that emphasizes shared
            decision-making that reflects the values, preferences, and treatment history of the patient with MDD. Tables
            provide new and updated recommendations for psychological, pharmacological, lifestyle, complementary and
            alternative medicine, digital health, and neuromodulation treatments. Caveats and limitations of the
            evidence are highlighted.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Conclusions</h3>
        <p>The CANMAT 2023 updated guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for the management of MDD, in a
            clinician-friendly format. These updated guidelines emphasize a collaborative, personalized, and systematic
            management approach that will help optimize outcomes for adults with MDD.</p>

    <h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Depressive illnessessuch as major depressive disorder (MDD) are common mental health conditions that
        significantly impact a person's quality of life and increase their risk of developing other health problems.
        Despite international calls to prioritize the recognition and treatment of MDD, only 20% of individuals with MDD
        will receive adequate treatment. Clinical guidelines are one tool for standardizing treatments to improve
        clinical care.</p>
    <p>The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) last published evidence-based guidelines for
        managing MDD in 2016 (previous iterations were published in 2001 and 2009). Since then, new research has emerged
        and new and updated treatment options for MDD are available. This 2023 update provides healthcare professionals
        with the latest evidence-informed recommendations for assessing and managing MDD. The updated guidelines focus
        on personalized care for individuals with MDD, considering their needs, preferences, and treatment history. They
        also highlight the importance of collaborating with patients in their care decisions and choice of
        evidence-based treatment options. To this end, patient partners are included in the core editorial group and as
        authors and reviewers of these guidelines.</p>
    <p>The guidelines development process is similar to previous CANMAT guidelines, with some exceptions. The familiar
        question–answer format is retained because clinicians continue to affirm its clinical practicality and ease of
        use. Questions were developed by a core editorial group with feedback from patient partners and organized into
        eight primary topics representing a patient care journey from assessment to acute treatment and maintenance,
        including treatment options for difficult-to-treat depression (DTD). We also incorporated lifestyle
        interventions such as exercise, nutrition, and sleep hygiene into treatment plans. The evidence review process
        focused on meta-reviews of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since 2015 (the literature search end
        date for the CANMAT 2016 guidelines), supplemented by other studies when those were not available. To enhance
        readability, only selected references are included in this publication; a complete citation list and summary of
        evidence reviews are available in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/07067437241245384"
            class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">online supplemental materials</a> (<a href="https://osf.io/8tfkp/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer">https://osf.io/8tfkp/</a>).</p>
    <p>Throughout these guidelines, all recommendations are accompanied by the level of evidence available to support
        each graded line of treatment. In addition, clinical support is used to rank recommendations, based on expert
        consensus from the CANMAT editorial group on factors including safety, tolerability, and feasibility, where
        possible. A rigorous method ensures consensus among the editorial group, and new or controversial topics are
        highlighted to clarify the rationale for recommendations.</p>
    <p>The scope of these guidelines is the management of MDD in adults, with a target audience of community-based
        psychiatrists and mental health providers. CANMAT previously published guidelines for bipolar disorder, in
        collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), and clinical guidelines for perinatal
        mood and anxiety-related disorders are in development; guidelines for other populations such as geriatric and
        pediatric depression are in planning. As done with previous versions, CANMAT will produce briefer summaries of
        the guidelines for clinicians, such as the CANMAT Pocket Guide to Depression. Additionally, the CHOICE-D Patient
        and Family Guide to Depression Treatment will be revised to reflect the content of the updated guidelines for
        patient and public knowledge dissemination.</p>

        <p>CANMAT convened a guidelines editorial group, comprised of academic clinicians (<em>n</em> = 43, representing
            diversity in seniority, region, and expertise) and a patient partner (KS), to direct and manage the 2023
            update. Methods, search strategies, and evidence tables are detailed on the project website on the Open
            Science Framework (OSF) (<a href="https://osf.io/8tfkp/" class="usa-link usa-link--external"
                data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://osf.io/8tfkp/</a>).
            High-quality, large-sample randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evidence.
            However, owing to the sheer volume of available RCTs, we prioritized systematic reviews and meta-analyses
            that synthesize many RCTs, for much of the evidence used and cited in these guidelines. We also recognize
            the limitations of meta-analyses; hence, we complemented them with results from large RCTs when making
            recommendations.</p>
        <p>We conducted comprehensive literature searches using appropriate keywords to identify systematic reviews and
            meta-analyses published between 1 January 2015 and 31 May 2023. In addition, we searched for RCTs and other
            studies when systematic reviews/meta-analyses were unavailable. Cross-referencing bibliographies, reviews of
            other major reports and guidelines, and expert feedback identified additional studies. Two independent
            reviewers selected relevant studies, with consensus adjudication by a third reviewer in cases of
            disagreement (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/07067437241245384"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Grading of Recommendations</h3>
        <p>The strength of evidence was evaluated based on the level of evidence criteria used in previous CANMAT
            guidelines (<a href="#table1-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table A</a>). We assessed the systematic
            reviews and meta-analyses for quality and risk of bias using modified global ratings from Grading of
            Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). The risk of bias for each study was
            assessed for methodology elements and rated as “Low” (few missing elements that are unlikely to affect the
            outcome), “Medium” (some missing elements that may possibly affect outcomes), and “High” (many missing or
            unclear elements, or clear bias in one element that is likely to affect the outcome). RCTs and other studies
            were considered when systematic reviews and meta-analyses were unavailable, with small-sample RCTs defined
            as those involving less than 30 participants per randomized condition. We use symbols to denote these levels
            of evidence (<a href="#table1-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table A</a>) when referencing in the text

        <p>Treatment recommendations are then organized along the lines of treatment, based on both strength of the
            evidence and clinical support (<a href="#table2-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table B</a>). Clinical
            support reflects expert consensus by the CANMAT editorial group on tolerability, safety, and feasibility.
            First-line treatments require higher-quality evidence (Level 1 or Level 2 evidence) and generally should be
            considered first in decision-making. Second- and third-line treatments should usually be considered only
            when first-line treatments are ineffective or unavailable. Treatments with Level 1 evidence for efficacy may
            be downgraded to second-line or third-line recommendations due to clinical concerns such as safety and side
            effect profile. Note that recommendations for principles of care (e.g. in Q.1, Q.2 and Q.5) are based
            primarily on Level 3 or Level 4 evidence, such as expert consensus.</p>

        <p>Drafts of these guidelines were reviewed by patient partners (see Acknowledgements) who received a small

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Funding and Conflict of Interest</h3>
        <p>The guidelines process and publication were funded by internal CANMAT funds; no external support was sought
            or received. No honoraria were paid to authors and no professional editorial assistance was used. All
            authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest. CANMAT is a project-driven academic organization governed
            by a volunteer, unpaid Advisory Board with no permanent staff or dedicated offices. CANMAT activities
            involve research, knowledge translation (e.g., guidelines dissemination, national and international
            conferences, and publications) and continuing professional development (CPD). CANMAT has a
            Conflict-of-Interest policy that includes disclosures by all participants, and academic institutions
            accredit all CPD projects. CANMAT activities are funded from various sources: academic projects from peer
            review or philanthropic agencies, and conferences and CPD funded by universities and industry sponsors.
            CANMAT research studies are independently funded by agencies such as the Canadian Institutes for Health
            Research (CIHR) and are administrated by the academic institutions of the principal investigators. In the
            past 5 years (2019–2023), sources of CANMAT revenue (excluding CIHR and research funding) included
            government funding agencies (52% of revenue), national scientific conferences (20% of revenue), and
            publications (28%); no pharmaceutical or industry funding was received.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Caveats and Limitations</h3>
        <p>While systematic reviews and meta-analyses are useful for summarizing data and are considered at the top of
            the evidence hierarchy, they reflect the quality of the original studies they synthesize. Their reliability
            can be limited by methodological factors, including the scope of the review, the criteria used for study
            selection, and the heterogeneity, quality, and generalizability of included studies. In addition, most
            meta-analyses assess the “risk of bias” to consider how findings could be influenced by factors such as
            author allegiance and funding source and whether adequate measures have been taken to minimize potential
            sources of bias. Yet, even meta-analyses with a low risk of bias have limitations, as their results may
            still be biased by including lower-quality studies, differ depending on methodological decisions, and be
            inconsistent with high-quality trials. Consequently, selecting evidence to include in clinical guidelines
            involves quality assessment. Sometimes, a single large high-quality RCT may provide a better guide for
            evidence than a meta-analysis that includes studies of lower quality, higher bias, or greater heterogeneity.
        </p>
        <p>Evaluation of many treatments and complex interventions also pose challenges due to lack of blinding and
            choice of comparison conditions. For example, studies comparing psychological treatments to minimal control
            conditions (such as waitlist) may not be as clinically relevant as studies that compare novel treatments to
            standard or usual care. Further, RCTs may have limited generalizability due to restrictive inclusion
            criteria. Accordingly, evidence from observational studies can complement controlled trials and is used
            where appropriate. Finally, while meta-analyses can track the evolution of evidence over time, it is
            recognized that early investigations of novel treatments tend to show larger effect sizes that decrease over
            subsequent years, particularly when the novel treatment becomes standard care. Given the rapid pace of
            research, CANMAT will review these guidelines again in 7 years (2030).</p>
        <p>In summary, owing to the variability of individual patient cases and limitations of the evidence base, few
            definitive or universally preferred treatments apply to all patients. Therefore, these CANMAT
            recommendations should be viewed as guidance for clinicians to consider within the context of each patient,
            rather than as established standards of care. Finally, since the CANMAT guidelines have a global reach and
            the evidence base is not country-specific, we note that some recommended treatments are not available in
            Canada and that regulatory requirements for medications vary from country to country.</p>

        <p>While various terms are used for lived experience, in these guidelines, the term <em>patient</em> refers to
            individuals with MDD in clinical treatment. We use the terms <em>mild</em>, <em>moderate</em>, and
            <em>severe</em> to describe the severity of a major depressive episode (MDE), based on the rating of symptom
            severity and degree of functional impairment, whichever is higher. We recommend the use of a validated
            rating scale to quantify these (see Q.5.a). As an example, an MDE of moderate severity could represent
            either moderately severe symptoms with mild–moderate functional impairment, or mild–moderate symptom
            severity with moderate impairment.</p>
        <p>Due to a lack of empirical differentiation between the terms <em>relapse</em> and <em>recurrence</em>, we use
            them interchangeably. We use the term <em>adjunctive</em> to refer to adding a second medication or
            treatment to an initial one (thereby replacing the term <em>augmentation</em>), whereas <em>combination</em>
            refers to starting two medications or treatments at the same time. <em>Sex</em> is used to denote biological
            sex at birth and <em>gender</em> is used to denote socially constructed roles, behaviours, and identities.
            Given that psychiatric conditions have somatic symptoms and represent a subset of all medical conditions, we
            use the term <em>nonpsychiatric medical conditions</em> to denote such as heart disease, neurological
            disorders, diabetes mellitus, etc. Finally, we use text boxes to highlight new or controversial topics. For
            example, <a href="#boxed-text1-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Box A</a> discusses the use of a newer
            nomenclature for medications.</p>

            <p>Neuroscience-Based Nomenclature for Medications.</p>
            <p>The prevailing nomenclature for psychotropic medications is not based on mechanism of action but instead
                is based primarily on indication (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics). Given that
                medications are often effective across a broad range of diagnostic categories, more scientific
                nomenclatures have emerged, including the Neuroscience-Based Nomenclature (NbN). In these guidelines, we
                will often use newer NbN terms to better describe medications according to mechanism of action, e.g.,
                <em>serotonin-dopamine activity modulator</em> instead of atypical antipsychotic, and <em>medication
                    indicated for anxiety</em> instead of anxiolytic. However, we will still use the older terms, such
                as <em>antidepressant</em>, because clinicians are still more familiar with these terms.</p>

    <h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Question 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis?</h2>
    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics from 2020, over 300 million individuals worldwide are
        estimated to be living with MDD. Within Canada, MDD constitutes a significant public health concern. The
        Canadian Community Health Survey found that ∼12% of Canadians aged 12 and older reported a lifetime episode of
        MDD; 4.7% of Canadians experienced an MDE within the past year. Not only is MDD highly prevalent, it results in
        social and occupational impairment, diminished quality of life, and an elevated risk of death by suicide. The
        Global Burden of Disease 2019 study indicated that depression is the second-ranked medical cause of disability
        worldwide.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.1.a. What are the Risk Factors for MDD?</h3>
        <p>Numerous risk factors for MDD have been identified, with varying strength of evidence (<a
                href="#table4-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 1.1</a>). Some are static and nonmodifiable
            historical factors such as a family history of depression and a history of adverse childhood experiences.
            Others are dynamic in that they may emerge and recede through the life span, such as psychiatric and
            nonpsychiatric medical illness, interpersonal or occupational stress, and bereavement. Clinicians should be

                middle age; there is no sex difference in prevalence of MDD in older age. A family history of mood
                disorders substantially increases the overall risk for MDD. A history of adverse childhood events or
                maltreatment, especially emotional abuse, bullying, physical neglect, and parental loss, is also
                strongly associated with a higher risk of MDD (and other psychiatric conditions) in adulthood. Death of

            <h4 class="pmc_sec_title">Dynamic, Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors</h4>
            <p>Many nonpsychiatric medical conditions, including chronic pain, cardiovascular illness, cancer,
                inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes mellitus, sleep disorders, obesity, and acne, are associated with
                increased risk for MDD, with most conditions having a bidirectional relationship. Periods of hormonal
                changes in women, e.g., perinatal and perimenopausal periods, are also high-risk times for MDD.</p>
            <p>There is a well-known association between alcohol use disorders and MDD, and there is evidence of a
                higher risk for MDD in other substance use disorders. For example, systematic reviews and meta-analyses
                show an association between opioid misuse/use disorders and depressive symptoms/disorders. Cannabis use
                during adolescence is also linked to an increased risk for depression in adulthood.</p>
            <p>Stressful life events and circumstances, including interpersonal stress, job strain and insecurity,
                income inequality, and challenging living environment, are associated with an increased risk of
                developing MDD even when correcting for pre-existing depressive symptoms and comorbid other medical
                conditions. Bereavement is a normal process, but severe or prolonged grief also can increase the risk of
                an MDE. Other modifiable factors associated with a greater risk of MDD include a sedentary lifestyle,
                increased screen time watching television or using mobile devices, and shift work.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.1.b. How and Who Should Be Screened for Depression?</h3>
        <p>Up to 60% of individuals with MDD are unrecognized or misidentified in primary care settings, and rates of
            under-detection are even higher in low- and middle-income countries. However, there is a lack of
            high-quality evidence to inform optimal strategies to improve detection and treatment uptake. Routine
            screening refers to having all patients (or at-risk groups) regularly complete screening procedures at
            prespecified times/intervals.</p>
        <p>Major extant guidelines provide conflicting recommendations regarding routine screening for depression in
            adults who appear at average risk (i.e., with no apparent symptoms of depression or risk factors), in part
            because of inconsistent evidence to support the benefits of screening and the challenges and costs of
            implementation. For example, the 2013 Canadian Task Force for Preventative Health recommended against
            routine depression screening for adults with average risk, although this was graded as a weak recommendation
            because of low-quality evidence. The CANMAT 2016 guidelines recommended screening for individuals with risk
            factors when resources were available for further assessment and treatment. The United States Preventative
            Services Task Force recently updated its evidence review and concluded that routine depression screening is
            associated with moderate net benefit and improved outcomes after 6 to 12 months, particularly in settings
            that provide additional interventions for those who screen positive <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. There are potential risks to routine screening, e.g.,
            stigmatization, impact on occupational or insurance status, and unnecessary psychological and/or
            pharmacological treatment for false-positive screens, but the prevalence and impact of these risks have not

        <p>Given the balance of evidence for benefits and minimal evidence for harms, CANMAT continues to recommend
            depression screening, using a validated scale, in primary and secondary care settings for patients who have
            risk factors (<a href="#table4-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 1.1</a>), provided there are

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.1.c. What Screening Tools can be Used?</h3>
        <p>There are many validated scales that can be used for depression screening. The 2-item Patient Health
            Questionnaire (PHQ-2), comprised of two items from the PHQ-9, is particularly useful in primary care because
            of its brevity. The PHQ-2 asks about feeling depressed/down/hopeless and experiencing anhedonia/lack of
            interest over the preceding 2 weeks, rating each answer on a scale of 0 to 3. A positive PHQ-2 (score ≥2)
            followed by a positive PHQ-9 (score ≥10) has similar sensitivity and better specificity compared to the
            PHQ-9 alone.</p>
        <p>The PHQ is available in many languages and digital formats and can be used for subsequent monitoring during
            measurement-based care (MBC; see Q.5.a). CANMAT therefore recommends using the PHQ-2 followed, if positive,
            by the PHQ-9 for depression screening <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

            symptoms, they are not diagnostic and positive screens should be followed by a full diagnostic assessment.

        <p>A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is the first step in the clinical management of MDD <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"

            Since MDD is a heterogeneous condition with a myriad of symptoms and presentations, a personalized
            assessment incorporating a diagnostic framework, such as DSM-5 or International Classification of
            Diseases-11 (ICD-11), allows exploration of individual differences. A comprehensive assessment should assess
            emotional, cognitive, and somatic symptoms, as well as vulnerability and resiliency factors across the life
            span, supplemented by collateral information whenever possible, and recognize ethnocultural diversity (<a
                href="#table5-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 1.2</a>). A history of childhood maltreatment
            and/or stressful/traumatic experiences is not always volunteered, so these should be explored sensitively
            during an assessment. The differential diagnosis should include psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical
            conditions that present with depressive symptoms, while recognizing that these conditions may also be
            comorbid with MDD.</p>

            <p>Principles of clinical assessment and management of major depressive disorder.</p>
            <p class="font-xs text-right text-italic" aria-label="Attribution">The first step is to conduct a thorough
                assessment of biological, psychological, and social factors, using collateral information when
                available, to formulate a diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Other management principles are
                discussed in subsequent questions (Q.2, Q.3, Q.5). Recommendations for principles of care are generally
                based on Level 3 and Level 4 evidence.</p>
        </figure>
        <p>Given the close relationships between MDD and other medical illnesses, a medical workup (including a detailed
            medical history and targeted physical examination) is important to rule out nonpsychiatric medical
            conditions. Although there is little direct evidence to support routine bloodwork, a complete blood count
            (CBC) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are low-cost blood tests that can help rule out anaemia and
            thyroid dysfunction as treatable causes of low mood and energy <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Other laboratory tests should be considered only when history and
            examination suggest other medical conditions in the differential diagnosis (e.g., testosterone or vitamin D
            deficiency) or in patients with other medical comorbidities, substance use disorders, older adults, or
            individuals with self-neglect and impaired judgment or communication <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>Similarly, there is no supportive evidence for routine electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography
            (EEG), or neuroimaging in patients presenting with MDD. These diagnostic tests should only be ordered when
            there are clinical indications <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. For instance, ECG should be considered in patients with
            cardiovascular diseases when using medications that potentially prolong QTc interval <img class="inline"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Neuroimaging should be considered in the presence of neurologic
            signs, new onset or persistent cognitive impairment, or sudden changes in mood, behaviour, or personality
            <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. In addition, neuroimaging may be recommended for patients with a

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.1.e. What are Diagnostic Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions?</h3>
        <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) includes subtypes within an MDE.
            These are classified as episode specifiers, based on cross-sectional symptoms of an MDE, and course
            specifiers, based on the longitudinal pattern of MDEs. Several episode specifiers (melancholic, atypical,
            psychotic, and catatonic features) are held over from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition,
            Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), while others (anxious distress and mixed features) are new in DSM-5-TR. Course
            specifiers include seasonal pattern (with primarily a winter pattern of MDEs) and peripartum onset.
            Specifiers are primarily useful for describing symptom and course patterns, with some utility for prognosis.
            However, they generally have limited value for selecting treatment (except for psychotic features and
            seasonal pattern, see Q.3.g and Q.3.m). Other clinical dimensions not identified in DSM-5-TR may be more
            useful for guiding treatment selection, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, somatic symptoms
            (e.g., pain, energy, and fatigue), and anhedonia (see Q.3.f).</p>
        <p>Finally, about 20% to 30% of individuals with MDEs have a chronic course lasting more than 2 years. In
            DSM-5-TR, a chronic MDE (with full criteria) is classified as a specifier of persistent depressive disorder
            (PDD), which is characterized by 2 or more depressive symptoms that are present for more than 2 years. MDE
            in partial remission after treatment is a separate PDD specifier. PDD specifiers also include dysthymia,
            which is a chronic course of subthreshold depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for MDE. This
            conflation of chronic MDE, partial remission MDE, and dysthymia makes it difficult to differentiate specific
            treatments for PDD (see Q.3.f). Regardless, compared to individuals with episodic MDEs, those with PDD show
            lower response rates to standard treatments and less likelihood of achieving remission. Management for PDD
            should employ the DTD framework, with the focus of treatment centred on improving quality of life and
            functioning instead of symptom remission <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.1.f. How can Access for Equity Deserving Groups be Improved?</h3>
        <p>Compared to the general population, the prevalence of MDD is higher in racialized, indigenous, gender
            minority, and certain religious populations. There is also a recognized lack of access and underutilization
            of mental health services for equity-deserving groups. The most common barriers to care include costs of
            treatment, cultural beliefs, stigma, language barriers, fear of being judged by the care provider, unequal
            geographic distribution of services, and fragmented health services. Some approaches to help overcome these
            barriers and reduce the existing gap in access to services include screening programs, incorporating
            culturally competent and collaborative care, and using digital health interventions (DHIs) tailored for
            equity-deserving groups (<a href="#table5-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 1.2</a>).</p>
        <p>Screening is underutilized in equity-deserving groups despite the availability of validated screening tools
            in many different languages and formats. Encouraging and training primary care providers to routinely screen
            for depression in equity-deserving groups using validated scales (e.g., the PHQ, available in many
            languages, and Q.1.c) increases access to mental health services, referrals, and treatment. Culturally
            competent care, in which a patient's sociocultural and language needs are explicitly addressed, is shown to
            improve psychiatric care and outcomes. Trauma-informed approaches should be used where indicated, e.g., for
            patients who are Indigenous, to account for the influence of transgenerational and other traumas on
            assessment and management <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Training mental health professionals in cultural competency,
            trauma-informed care, healthcare disparities and personal bias also improves care and access for
            equity-deserving groups. Collaborative care, a healthcare delivery system comprised of case managers
            alongside primary care providers and mental health specialists (see Q.2.g), may be particularly effective
            for patients from equity-deserving groups and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>Finally, telehealth and DHIs (see Q.4) may also provide benefits for equity-deserving groups, as they can
            address language, stigma, and geographic disparities in service. Systematic reviews have shown that
            telehealth, delivered in the patient's preferred language with cultural adaptation and cultural matching of
            patients and providers, improves health outcomes and access to services <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Other studies show that DHIs are promising resources to enhance
            screening and service delivery. However, challenges with digital literacy and technology costs are barriers
            to the scale-up of digital services for many patients (see Q.4.b).</p>

    <section id="section4A-07067437241245384">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.a. What are the Phases and Objectives of Treatment?</h3>
        <p>The general objectives of MDD treatment are to achieve symptomatic remission, recover full functioning,
            restore quality of life, and prevent recurrence, while ensuring patient safety and acceptability of
            treatments. The specific goals of treatment should be individualized using a patient-centred approach
            whereby clinicians understand a patient's unique goals and needs, to promote shared decision-making (SDM)
            and collaboration in determining relevant outcomes (see Q.2.d).</p>
        <p>These guidelines retain the 2-phase treatment model (acute and maintenance phases) from the CANMAT 2016
            guidelines (<a href="#table6-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 2.1</a>). The main objectives of the
            acute phase of treatment are to address patient safety and select evidence-based treatments to improve
            symptom severity and functioning. Remission of symptoms, defined as the resolution or near-resolution of
            symptoms (operationalized using validated rating scales, see Q.5.b), is an important target of acute
            treatment (see Q.2.b). Specific actions and activities of the acute phase are listed in <a
                href="#table6-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 2.1</a>. Psychoeducation and self-management are
            integral to MDD management <img class="inline"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Psychoeducation refers to knowledge and information about the
            symptoms, coping strategies and treatment options for depression, whereas self-management uses techniques
            (e.g., problem-solving, lifestyle changes, and behavioural activation [BA]) to empower patients to actively
            manage their illness and live well. Many resources are available, both in print and online, to support
            effective self-management for MDD, including the CHOICE-D patient guide.</p>

        <p>The main objectives of the maintenance phase (<a href="#table6-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table
                2.1</a>) are to consolidate symptom remission, restore both functioning and quality of life to premorbid
            levels, and prevent recurrence of symptoms (see Q.6). When clinically indicated, acute phase treatments may
            be tapered and discontinued. Finally, interventions to promote resilience can be used during the maintenance
            phase to help prevent recurrence.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.b. Why is Symptom Remission Important?</h3>
        <p>Symptom remission remains a crucial clinical target for acute treatment, as substantial evidence supports a
            lower risk of relapse in those who achieve remission compared with those who do not <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. In contrast, failure to achieve remission is associated with
            continuing symptom burden and poor functional outcomes. Evidence supports symptomatic remission as a
            realistic goal of acute phase treatment for most patients both in psychiatric and primary care settings.
            However, in defining remission and recovery, patients often regard aspects of functioning and quality of
            life as more important than the absence of symptoms. Hence, symptom remission, while important, should be
            considered only an intermediate objective for optimal treatment outcomes.</p>
        <p>It is also worth noting that persistent depressive symptoms are common even in individuals who otherwise
            achieve symptom remission. These “residual” symptoms should be identified and treated because persisting
            symptoms represent a major risk factor for recurrence (see Q.6.c). Isolated, mild, and intermittent symptoms
            can be treated using a symptom-targeted approach with a focus on patient comfort and functionality (e.g.,
            using a short-term medication for insomnia).</p>
        <p>Finally, some patients, such as those with PDD, may not achieve symptom remission despite treatment with
            several evidence-based approaches. For these patients with DTD, the therapeutic focus should shift away from
            symptom remission towards prioritizing the best possible improvement in functioning and quality of life (see
            Q.7.b).</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.c. How are Suicide and Safety Risks Managed?</h3>
        <p>The risk of suicide attempts in individuals with MDD is 5-fold higher than in the general population. In
            Canada, there are about 15 deaths by suicide for every 100,000 males, compared to about 5 deaths for every
            100,000 females, representing over 4000 suicide deaths per year. Of those who die by suicide, about half
            suffer from MDD, the most prevalent mental illness in these individuals. Hence, assessing suicide risk and
            developing and implementing a tailored safety plan are priorities for risk management in MDD.</p>
        <p>Suicide risk assessment should be a routine part of psychiatric interviews, especially in emergency room
            settings, with the aim of making patients feel genuinely listened to and validated. The focus of the risk
            assessment in the psychiatric interview and subsequent risk formulation should be to understand the basis
            for suicidal ideation/behaviour, personal strengths and protective factors that can be leveraged for safety
            planning, and foreseeable changes (<a href="#table7-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 2.2</a>). The
            assessment should identify potentially modifiable risk factors (<a href="#table7-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Table 2.2</a>) because historical and demographic factors which are associated with
            overrepresentation in deaths by suicide (e.g., male sex, older age, family history of suicide, etc.) are not
            helpful for risk assessment. Validated suicide risk scales are available but they have low sensitivity and
            predictive power for suicide behaviours and should only be used alongside clinician judgment (see Q.5.a).

            psychotic symptoms), treatment in an inpatient setting is often warranted. The goals of care should include
            monitoring the severity of suicidal ideation, timely pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments,
            modifying the patient's environment and circumstances (e.g., removing lethal means from the home and
            bolstering support in the community) and ensuring regular follow-up. The month after both initiating and
            stopping an antidepressant are periods of increased risk for suicide, which require enhanced surveillance
            and safety planning (see Q.3.g). In Canada and the United States, the 9-8-8 telephone number allows rapid
            access to help by phone or text for people who are suicidal or their family members, or for clinicians
            seeking guidance to help a patient at risk for suicide.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.d. What is the Role of Patient Preference?</h3>
        <p>Patient preference plays a key role in depression management. SDM helps establish a strong therapeutic
            alliance which facilitates psychoeducation about critical aspects of the treatment, including achieving
            symptom remission and promoting long-term mental wellness. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware
            of the broad range of treatment options available for MDD, including lifestyle changes and self-management,
            psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
            treatments. Clinicians also should explain how treatments work and dispel myths and stigma (e.g., related to
            medications or role of stress). CANMAT has created a patient and family guide to depression treatment
            (CHOICE-D) as a psychoeducational aid, available for free download at <a href="http://www.CANMAT.org"
                class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">www.CANMAT.org</a>.</p>
        <p>Discussions with patients should also acknowledge the local realities of the healthcare ecosystem, including
            any limitations to accessing evidence-based psychological and neuromodulation treatments. Moreover, every
            effort should be made to provide treatments preferred by patients. Given the many evidence-based options, it
            is advisable for clinicians and patients to agree upon a shared treatment plan with an explanation as to why
            a specific treatment is recommended, and to offer one or more alternative options so that patients can
            select and adhere to the care plan that aligns with their values and needs.</p>
        <p>In the SDM model, the clinician and patient contribute mutually to the decision-making process. Meta-analyses
            find that, while SDM may not significantly improve treatment adherence or symptom change, it increases
            patient knowledge, communication, and satisfaction. CANMAT recommends introducing elements of SDM to improve
            the care experience for people with depression <img class="inline"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Patient preference should especially be considered with other
            clinical factors when selecting treatment options, including psychological and pharmacological
            interventions.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.e. How Does Treatment Cost and Access Influence Management?</h3>
        <p>Treatment costs and health insurance coverage may significantly influence treatment decisions for patients.
            Publicly funded health care systems may offer only limited or no access to certain evidence-based treatments
            for depression, especially psychological, neuromodulation, and infusion treatments. Access to these
            treatments may be available in private health care settings, but cost may be a significant barrier for many
            patients. Cost may also play a role in medication treatments, given that, in general, newer medications are
            more expensive than those for which generic formulations are available. When formulating a treatment plan
            with patients, clinicians should be familiar with the costs of treatments and their patient's insurance
            coverage and ability to pay, if needed <img class="inline"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective?</h3>
        <p>Different lifestyle factors have been implicated in the risk of both developing MDD and worsening symptom
            severity. For instance, insomnia can raise the likelihood of depressive episodes and is also a common
            residual symptom. Similarly, the relationship between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms may be
            bidirectional, with individuals using smoking to alleviate depressive symptoms (self-medication) while
            smoking, in turn, may increase susceptibility to depressive symptoms. Lifestyle modifications such as
            exercise or an increase in physical activity, a healthier diet, smoking cessation, and sleep hygiene are
            beneficial in MDEs (<a href="#table9-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 2.4</a>).</p>

        <p>The CANMAT 2016 guidelines noted substantial evidence for the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for MDD
            <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT methods, recent
            meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual
            conditions in MDD, with medium to large effects <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects
            when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the
            supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to
            moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults.
            Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these
            findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to
            40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild
            depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"

        <p>Maintaining healthy sleep and circadian rhythms are important lifestyle issues. There is a bidirectional
            relationship between sleep and depression, whereby sleep disturbances (insomnia and hypersomnia) are common
            symptoms of MDEs but disturbed sleep also increases the risk of developing MDD. Hence, restoring restful
            sleep is an important objective in MDD treatment and prevention. Although there is limited clinical trial
            evidence, instructing patients on sleep hygiene is likely beneficial <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Small-sample RCTs also find that a variant of
            cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored to address insomnia (CBT-I) shows promising effects in MDD <img
                class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>In contrast to improving sleep, sleep deprivation (also called wake therapy) has long been described as
            having a rapid but transient antidepressant effect in MDD. While open-label studies show the benefit of
            sleep deprivation (both total and partial) as an adjunctive treatment, a recent meta-analysis found no
            benefit for studies where treatments that included sleep deprivation were compared to the same treatment
            without sleep deprivation <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Hence, sleep deprivation remains a third-line recommendation for
            MDD (Table 2.4). One caution with overnight sleep deprivation is that it may precipitate hypomanic episodes
            in some susceptible individuals not previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
        <p>Exposure to natural light is important for maintaining circadian rhythmicity. Light therapy is a
            chronobiological intervention in which a device delivers timed exposure to supplemental bright light. A
            typical protocol for light therapy uses 10,000 lux fluorescent white light for 30 min daily in the morning,
            shortly after awakening. Light therapy continues to be recommended as first-line monotherapy for seasonal
            (winter) depression (seasonal pattern course specifier in DSM-5-TR) with several consistent supportive
            meta-analyses <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Despite some heterogeneity, recent meta-analyses also find

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">, with larger effects when light therapy is combined with

            refined carbohydrates and saturated fat, and low content of fruits and vegetables, commonly called the
            Western diet) with increased prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms <img class="inline"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. In contrast, there are few interventional studies of diet
            manipulation. There is only 1 RCT showing a modest effect of a Mediterranean-type diet in adults with MDD,
            supporting a third-line recommendation <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"

            supporting nor refuting beneficial effects. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics in
            the treatment of MDD.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.2.g. Who Delivers and Monitors Care?</h3>
        <p>Several service delivery models have evidence of benefit for the management of MDD, including stepped care,
            stratified care, and collaborative care. Each of these models emphasizes evidence-based treatments, but the
            mode of treatment selection and delivery differs for each framework. Regardless of the model, when 2 or more
            clinicians are involved in a patient's care, ensuring timely and effective communication is essential to
            maintain continuity of care.</p>
        <p>Stepped-care delivery refers to a care model in which patients access sequential treatments of increasing
            intensity as needed, according to prespecified criteria such as severity of illness. Patients usually enter
            at the least intensive “step” shown to be effective for their illness and move up or down depending on
            symptom progression or response. For example, people with mild severity MDEs may be appropriate for
            lower-intensity interventions while those with more severe and high-risk episodes are streamed to start with
            higher-intensity programs. In contrast to stepped care, stratified care refers to models in which patients
            are initially matched to receive treatments customized to both the severity and complexity of their needs.
            Both models are efficacious and cost-effective in managing depression <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>Collaborative care models are primary care frameworks that emphasize multidisciplinary involvement with 2 or
            more health professionals. Collaborative care (also variously called shared care and integrated care) is
            effective in reducing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in primary care settings, especially in
            patients with comorbid medical conditions and from equity-deserving groups, including those from low
            socioeconomic backgrounds <img class="inline"

        <p>The choice of initial treatment for MDD is an important and consequential decision that should be made
            collaboratively between clinician and patient. Information sharing should include the range of potential
            treatments, the evidence supporting each, the nature and severity of depression, and the personal situation,

        <p>For MDE with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy
            have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily
            accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with
            exercise, CAM (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by
            patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy,
            compared to these treatments.</p>
        <p>For MDE of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured
            psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent
            evidence for safety and efficacy <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on
            context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant
            medications are equally effective in treating MDD in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more
            efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms
            during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT), is more efficacious than
            antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy
            should also be considered <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Finally, exercise, certain CAM treatments, and DHIs can also be
            used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the
            patient.</p>
        <p>In severe cases of MDE with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT recommends the
            combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a
            staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic"> (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE with psychotic symptoms, the
            combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is
            recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside <img

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined?</h3>
        <p>Combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute
            treatment; combined treatment also is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The strongest evidence
            supports in-person CBT (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT]) initiated sequentially after
            treatment with an antidepressant is established <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of
            depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding
            psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the
            antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an
            antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes
            treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should
            be considered (see Q.6.d).</p>
        <p>Planned sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after initial response to pharmacotherapy) may be
            especially useful for individuals with recurrent and severe forms of depression who carry a high risk of
            relapse following a monotherapy treatment <img class="inline"

        <p>Meta-analytic comparisons of different psychotherapies are difficult to interpret due to methodological
            challenges, including lack of blinding and the effects of allegiance to a particular model. A network
            meta-analysis ranked CBT, IPT, and BA as the top psychotherapies based on outcome measures reflecting
            treatment response and acceptability. Other psychotherapies were supported by less consistent evidence and
            are recommended as second-line and third-line treatments (see Q.3.f).</p>
        <p>Psychotherapy is similarly effective across most demographic factors, including sex, age, level of education,
            culture, and ethnicity, hence these patient factors are not informative for choosing the initial
            psychotherapy. As for clinical factors, illness severity primarily affects the urgency with which the
            treatment must begin; the more severe the illness, the more imperative it is to start treatment as soon as
            possible to avert the risk of harm. The severity of MDE does not predict outcomes in CBT versus
            pharmacotherapy; however, the combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment is more effective
            than either alone and should be considered in severe cases (see Q.3.b). Importantly, meta-analytic evidence
            suggests that CBT reduces suicide attempts by half in those who attempted suicide in the previous 6 months;
            therefore, the addition or initiation of CBT may be considered for people with a recent history of a suicide
            attempt <img class="inline"

        <p>Most improvement occurs during the early sessions of psychological treatments, with diminishing gains
            thereafter. However, the relationship between the number of treatment sessions attended and the degree of
            therapeutic improvement remains unclear. Therefore, optimal doses of psychotherapy have been proposed based
            on the number of sessions in which at least 50% of patients respond to treatment, owing to the decreasing
            probability of improvement after this cut-off. The strongest evidence suggests that an optimal dose for a
            first-line psychotherapy, for most patients, is 12 to 16 sessions <img class="inline"

        <p>The frequency of treatment sessions is also related to patient benefit, with increased frequency of

            individual antidepressants, with some differences between classes of antidepressants. For example,
            frequently reported adverse effects for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
            serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are gastrointestinal and sexual, while for tricyclic
            antidepressants (TCAs) they are anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth and constipation. <a
                href="#table13-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.4</a> lists rates of adverse events for
            first-line antidepressants, according to product monographs that summarize results from clinical trial data
            (note that the rates are not adjusted for placebo rates of adverse effects). Certain important side effects
            (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) are not included in <a href="#table13-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Table 3.4</a> because they are not adequately assessed in short-term clinical trials,

        <p>For most adults with MDD, the choice of the first antidepressant is based on the balance of efficacy and
            tolerability. The previously cited network meta-analysis allows a comparison of differences in efficacy (as
            defined by response rate) and acceptability (a proxy for tolerability, defined as discontinuation from the
            study for all causes) among many treatments (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). In this network
            meta-analysis, agomelatine, escitalopram, and vortioxetine showed advantages over other antidepressants when
            considering both efficacy and acceptability <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>However, these comparative differences among antidepressants are small and other data sources should be
            included when comparing efficacy, tolerability and other important characteristics. <a
                href="#table14-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.5</a> summarizes comparative ratings for the
            first-line antidepressants in categories of efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, drug interactions (see
            Q.3.j), and potential discontinuation effects (see Q.6.d). These comparative ratings are based on various
            data sources including meta-analyses and RCTs, supplemented by expert consensus from the CANMAT authors.
            Note that while ratings show those agents that have more favourable profiles and those with less favourable
            profiles, these are not absolute ratings; an agent can be selected for other clinical reasons despite having
            a rating as less favourable on a particular characteristic.</p>
        <p>Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine,
            sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although
            these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability
            (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug
            interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential
            interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical
            risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD with comorbid cardiovascular disease
            (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most
            antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes
            the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.</p>
        <p><a href="#table14-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.5</a> also summarizes comparative ratings for
            side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside
            a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results
            from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some
            treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight
            loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire,
            arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with
            serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several
            antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are
            associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of
            depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side
            effects.</p>
        <p>In addition to efficacy and tolerability, patient and clinical factors may also be considered in selecting
            antidepressant medication in some cases, including episode specifiers and symptom dimensions (see Q.3.g).
            While most antidepressants appear to be effective irrespective of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline
            severity, age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. For patients over age 65, SSRIs may be
            less effective and SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may be more effective <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. For young patients up to age 25, the balance of efficacy, adverse
            reactions and risk of discontinuation symptoms may favour using fluoxetine or agomelatine over other
            antidepressants <img class="inline"

            <p>First-line psychotherapies (CBT, IPT, and BA) for the acute treatment of depression are supported by new
                evidence since the CANMAT 2016 guidelines. Most previous second-line psychological treatments continue
                to build their evidence base, including cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP),
                mindfulness-based interventions including MBCT, problem-solving therapy (PST), and short-term
                psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

                    3.2</a>). Recent meta-analyses support the efficacy of these second-line treatments, while also
                highlighting limitations such as heterogeneity and risk of bias. Meta-analyses also show that acceptance
                and commitment therapy (ACT) has efficacy when compared to inactive controls and in those with mild
                depression, hence, ACT remains a third-line recommendation <img class="inline"

            <p>Two new psychological treatments have accrued enough evidence to be included as second-line or third-line
                treatments for MDD. First, transdiagnostic or “unified” psychological treatment of emotional disorders,
                including anxiety and depression, incorporates motivational enhancement, psychoeducation, training in
                emotional awareness, cognitive restructuring, emotion-driven behaviours (including avoidance), tolerance
                of physical sensations (including exposure), and relapse prevention. A positive meta-analysis supports
                its inclusion as a second-line treatment for MDD, which may be particularly useful in the context of
                concurrent anxiety issues <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

                    3.2</a>). Second, metacognitive therapy (MCT) for depression focuses on the awareness and
                understanding of the thoughts and feelings of oneself as well as others; this treatment is typically
                goal-directed and enhances metacognitive capacities to gain more flexibility in the attention,
                monitoring, control, and regulation of cognitive processes. The efficacy evidence in MDD supports MCT as
                a third-line recommendation <img class="inline"

            <p>A new combination medication, dextromethorphan with low-dose bupropion, was approved in 2022 in the
                United States of America (USA; not available in Canada), based on clinical trials showing an advantage
                over placebo and low-dose bupropion alone. Dextromethorphan is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
                receptor antagonist, opioid sigma-1 receptor agonist, and SNRI, that is used as a cough suppressant and
                a common ingredient of cough and cold medications. The addition of bupropion increases the
                bioavailability of dextromethorphan through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 liver enzyme;
                bupropion also is a reuptake inhibitor/releaser of dopamine and norepinephrine. Given the limited
                evidence, the potential for misuse, and the lack of long-term safety data, the
                dextromethorphan-bupropion combination is recommended as a second-line treatment <img class="inline"

        <p>In the CANMAT 2016 guidelines, the DSM-5-TR episode specifiers, melancholic features and atypical features,
            were not associated with specific treatment recommendations. Other specifiers had limited evidence for
            specific treatments, such as recommendations for benzodiazepines or ECT for catatonic features, and
            combination antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment, or ECT, for psychotic features. There is no new
            evidence available to change these recommendations (<a href="#table15-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Table 3.6</a>). Similarly, the DSM-5-TR specifier, with anxious distress, has a
            prognostic value in that MDE with anxiety is associated with poorer response to standard treatments.
            However, there is no evidence for better responses with any specific medication, hence all first-line
            antidepressants are recommended for anxious distress.</p>

        <p>The DSM-5-TR mixed features specifier describes an MDE presenting with both depressive symptoms and
            subsyndromal manic symptoms. It may be challenging to differentiate MDD with mixed features from mixed
            states found in bipolar disorders, hence, patients manifesting mixed symptoms should be managed in
            consultation with a psychiatrist <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Owing to the short history of the mixed features specifier for
            MDD, there is minimal RCT evidence for treatment. Given this paucity of data, first-line antidepressants are
            still recommended for MDE with mixed features (<a href="#table15-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table
                3.6</a>). However, close monitoring for activating side effects (e.g., agitation and increase in
            suicidal ideation), and potential manic/hypomanic switch, is recommended when initiating antidepressants
            <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. The serotonin-dopamine activity modulator, lurasidone, is
            recommended as a second-line agent for patients with MDD and mixed features because of an RCT showing
            efficacy compared to placebo <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

        <p>The 2016 CANMAT guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have
            treatment specificity (<a href="#table15-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.6</a>). Cognitive
            symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD and medications
            such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to
            SSRIs <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

            Anhedonia, the reduced ability to experience pleasure, is often clinically expressed as reduced motivational
            drive and decreased consummatory pleasure. Although there is, as yet, no evidence that any specific agent
            has superior anti-anhedonia properties compared to other medications, anhedonia is a promising symptom
            dimension for future clinical trials (<a href="#boxed-text2-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Box

            <p>Anhedonia as a Treatment Target.</p>
            <p>There is significant clinical and research interest in anhedonia as a primary and persisting symptom of
                MDD (as well as other conditions) and specific treatment approaches. Anhedonia is reported by up to 70%
                of patients with MDD and its presence is associated with a reduced likelihood of remission with SSRI
                treatment, possibly because anhedonia may be an indicator of dopaminergic dysfunction. A meta-analysis
                suggests that monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine, methylphenidate and psilocybin are associated, in
                varying degrees, with improvement in the severity of anhedonia. In contrast, escitalopram and riluzole
                were not as effective in improving anhedonia in MDD. Several investigational medications are in early
                phase trials to target anhedonia as a primary outcome.</p>

        <p>Collectively, evidence supports the conclusion that antidepressants reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviours,
            with a greater effect on suicidal ideation than on prevention of suicide attempts and death <img
                class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. This conclusion, however, does not exclude the possibility that
            antidepressants may also increase suicidality in a subset of patients. Increased suicide risk may be
            associated with patient age and the time period of antidepressant use. When examining the risk of suicidal
            behaviour (death by suicide, attempted suicide, or preparatory acts), a meta-analysis of RCTs found that,
            compared with placebo, acute treatment with antidepressant medication is associated with increased risk
            among young adults below age 25, but with a decreased risk of suicidal behaviours among those aged 65 and
            older; in adults aged 25 to 65, there is no effect <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. In contrast to these results, a meta-analysis of observational
            studies found a modest increase in suicidal behaviour associated with antidepressants that were not
            age-dependent (although there was no increase in a subanalysis of SSRIs only) <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Additionally, suicidal behaviour is noted to be highest in the
            month before antidepressant initiation (indicating that suicidality predates medication use), remains high
            in the month after antidepressant initiation, and then declines with continued use of antidepressants <img

        <p>In summary, the initial few weeks before and after starting any treatment is a higher risk period for
            suicide. While antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small proportion of patients may
            experience increased suicidal ideation when initiating antidepressants, especially young people. CANMAT
            recommends routine monitoring of suicide risk for all patients during antidepressant treatment, with
            enhanced attention during the first 4 weeks following a new antidepressant prescription and after stopping
            the medication <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"

            clinicians should ensure that they are aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviours
            before initiating an antidepressant. Clinicians also should educate patients that if they experience an
            increase in suicidal thoughts when starting a new medication, they should (a) understand them as a
            medication side effect; (b) be aware that increasing suicidal thoughts indicate a need for urgent action to
            address distress and other symptoms; (c) implement a safety plan (see Q.2.c); and (d) reach out to their
            care provider, crisis line (e.g., call 9-8-8 in Canada and the USA), or an emergency department <img

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants?</h3>
        <p>Most first-line antidepressants have a well-established safety record and can be combined with other commonly
            prescribed medications without significant risk of interactions (summarized in <a
                href="#table13-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.4</a>). Here, we highlight exceptions to this
            rule and cases where caution is warranted.</p>
        <p>SSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures and falls, particularly in older adults. Most
            SSRIs have few clinically relevant effects on CYP isoenzymes and have low risk for drug interactions.
            Exceptions are fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine, which is a
            potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These antidepressants can increase blood levels of
            concurrent medications that are substrates of these CYP450 isoenzymes. Combining SSRIs with nonsteroidal
            anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal
            bleeding, which is mitigated with the use of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, concurrent use of SSRIs
            with diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, especially
            in older adults. Mianserin and agomelatine (both not available in Canada or the USA) are the only
            antidepressants not associated with hyponatremia 7. SNRIs can cause increases in blood pressure and share
            the risk of interactions with NSAIDs and diuretics noted for SSRIs.</p>
        <p>A rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up
            to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are
            associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk.
            Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in
            appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.</p>
        <p>The safety considerations of antidepressants are partly age-dependent. While SSRIs and SNRIs are generally
            safe in adults, the extremes of the adult age range are linked to an increased risk of some adverse events.
            For example, SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with an increased risk of akathisia, agitation, and aggression
            in young individuals under age 25 years <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. The risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, liver
            damage, and QTc prolongation are most prominent in adults over age 65 years <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>TCAs are at higher risk of life-threatening effects in overdose, as they can lead to altered mental status,
            cardiac toxicity, and seizures. SSRIs should be preferentially considered for individuals with a significant
            risk of overdosing <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have the potential to cause
            life-threatening interactions (serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis) when combined with medications
            affecting monoamine metabolism (e.g., dextromethorphan-containing cough syrups, dextromethorphan-bupropion
            combination, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors), herbal remedies (St John's wort) or food items containing
            high levels of tyramine (cured meats, mature cheeses, and fermented products such as miso, kimchi, and
            marmite). Because of these potential interactions, MAOIs are reserved as a third-line option and should be
            prescribed only after providing detailed guidance on avoiding interacting medications and foods <img

        <p>Several commercially available pharmacogenetic tests (also called pharmacogenomic tests) provide
            recommendations to inform the selection and dosing of antidepressants to reduce the likelihood of adverse
            reactions and increase the likelihood of positive responses. Currently, available tests are based on
            variants in genes that code for enzymes responsible for the metabolism of psychotropic medication, with some
            tests combining variants in genes coding for serotonin transporter and receptors. Meta-analyses show higher
            response and remission rates with pharmacogenetic testing compared to usual care, albeit with modest effect
            sizes, especially in absolute risk reductions (e.g., for response rates, ranging from 4.6 to 7.2 percentage
            points difference in favour of pharmacogenetic testing) <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Moreover, the RCTs included in the meta-analyses have significant
            risks of bias, primarily with a lack of blinding. Hence, CANMAT does not recommend the routine use of
            pharmacogenetic tests, because the clinical benefits are too modest and inconsistent to justify the delay in
            treatment associated with obtaining the test results <img class="inline"

            <p>Tricyclic Antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.</p>
            <p>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are efficacious
                treatments for MDD, but they are downgraded to second-line and third-line medications (<a
                    href="#table12-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 3.3</a>), respectively, because of less
                favourable side effect and safety profiles compared to first-line agents, and/or the need for dietary
                and drug restrictions (Q.3.j). Some TCAs have a more favourable side effect profile than others. For
                example, nortriptyline has the fewest anticholinergic and hypotensive adverse effects; it has a good
                safety and efficacy profile in elderly and post-stroke depression populations.</p>
            <p>These older medications continue to have an important role in managing treatment-resistant depression
                (TRD) and difficult-to-treat depression (DTD). TCAs have evidence for superior efficacy in TRD and may
                have specificity for subpopulations of patients with MDD, e.g., amitriptyline for comorbid painful
                conditions and clomipramine for comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. Another advantage of TCAs is
                that, in contrast to newer antidepressants, serum levels can be informative to adjust dosing. MAOIs are
                also efficacious in TRD and have a different mechanism of action compared to first-line and second-line
                agents. Hence, TCAs and MAOIs should be considered as therapeutic options when first-line and
                second-line medication treatments are not effective, with patients monitored carefully for side effects
                and potential for drug interactions.</p>
        </section>
        <p>However, pharmacogenetic testing or plasma level monitoring may be useful in some clinical situations, e.g.,
            when there are severe or unusual adverse effects with low doses of medications, or when there is poor
            response to therapeutic doses. In these situations, the tests may help identify the small proportion
            (although this can vary in certain populations) of individuals with atypical metabolizer status and/or
            unexpected plasma levels <img class="inline"

        <p>A biomarker is an objective measure of any substance, structure, or process in the body or its products that
            may influence or predict a disease, prognosis, or treatment outcome. Biomarkers such as plasma levels of
            specific proteins, imaging or electrophysiological measures of brain function have been examined as
            potential indicators to predict which treatment may work for which person. Inflammatory markers in the
            peripheral blood and electrophysiological measures of brain function have shown consistent associations with
            antidepressant treatment outcomes. For example, increased levels of interleukin 8 and the C-reactive protein
            have been associated with worse responses to SSRIs. Because of the small effect size of these associations,
            CANMAT does not recommend measuring these biomarkers for routine antidepressant selection <img

            for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM
            treatments. CANMAT therefore recommends the consideration of CAM treatments alone only for MDE of mild
            severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate
            severity illness.</p>
        <p>Herbal compounds include St. John's wort, which has evidence for efficacy in mild depression <img

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Caution is warranted when combining St. John's wort with
            serotonergic medications (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs), as there is an uncertain risk of serotonin syndrome. In
            addition, St. John's wort is a potent CYP 3A4 inducer with risk for drug interactions, which is an important
            consideration since it is available as an over-the-counter medication. Although maintenance studies and
            efficacy data in more severe illnesses are lacking, St. John's wort is recommended as a first-line treatment
            for MDE of mild severity <img class="inline"

        <p>Other herbs such as <em>Crocus sativus</em> (saffron), <em>Lavandula</em> (lavender), and <em>Rhodiola</em>
            (roseroot) have only modest evidence for benefit in MDE. A meta-analysis found the efficacy of saffron for
            reducing depressive symptoms when compared to placebo and as an adjunct to antidepressants. Another
            meta-analysis on the efficacy of lavender reported a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to control
            conditions. However, given the modest benefit and the major limitations of the RCTs, saffron, lavender, and

        <p>Acupuncture has also been studied in depression, with several meta-analyses showing the efficacy of

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.3.n. How are Comorbid Conditions Managed?</h3>
        <p>Comorbidity with psychiatric and other medical conditions is common in MDD. For example, high rates of
            psychiatric comorbidity (10% to 30% for many disorders, e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity [ADHD]
            disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders; and 40% to 60% for anxiety disorders) are
            reported in patients with MDD. Similarly, rates of comorbid MDD are high (10% to 30%) in patients with
            nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic
            pain, among others. The bidirectional nature of the relationships between depression and many medical
            conditions underscores the importance of recognizing and treating comorbidities with MDD.</p>
        <p>A review of treatment for specific comorbid conditions is beyond the scope of these guidelines. Generally,
            the presence of a comorbid condition makes MDD more difficult to treat, and depressive symptoms may be
            conflated with symptoms of the other condition. Similarly, it may be difficult to distinguish the side
            effects of depression treatment from the side effects of concomitant medications. It is important to
            minimize polypharmacy and check for drug interactions with concomitant medications to avoid iatrogenic
            adverse effects. The choice of pharmacotherapy should also consider medication side effect profiles that do
            not worsen comorbid conditions.</p>
        <p>For pharmacological treatments, patients with psychiatric and other medical comorbidities have a worse
            treatment response to antidepressants than those without <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. However, antidepressants remain indicated for treating MDD with
            comorbidities. An umbrella systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs for MDD comorbid with 27 other
            medical conditions reported that antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo across a range of
            medical comorbidities, including myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, inflammatory bowel
            disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer among others <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>For psychological treatments, patients with comorbid other medical conditions benefit from psychological
            treatments similarly to those without <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Despite the limitations of heterogeneity in studies, recent
            meta-analyses support the efficacy of psychological treatments, such as CBT and BA, for specific medical
            comorbidities, including coronary heart disease and neurological conditions <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>The CANMAT 2016 guidelines cited evidence that the presence of any personality disorder with MDD reduced the
            benefit of psychotherapy. Recent evidence from higher-quality studies, focusing on CBT, no longer supports
            this finding. Hence, CBT (16 to 20 sessions) is recommended for patients with depression and concurrent
            personality disorder <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. CBT of greater complexity (i.e., including therapeutic components

        <p>Most research supporting evidence-based psychological treatment for depression relies on samples from
            dominant cultural groups such as White North Americans and Europeans. However, evidence in support of these
            treatments in other countries and cultural groups is growing, e.g., CBT for Arabic-speaking adults and

    <h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs?</h2>
    <section id="section6A-07067437241245384">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.4.a. What are DHIs?</h3>
        <p>Digital health technologies refer broadly to the use of computers, smartphones, and tablet devices for a
            variety of purposes, including disease screening, monitoring, treatment, and preventing recurrence. The term
            also encompasses wearables such as activity trackers, digital phenotyping, text or SMS messaging, and
            videoconferencing for virtual care. For this guideline, we use the term, DHIs, to denote internet programs
            or mobile apps that deliver depression treatment.</p>
        <p>Many DHIs provide tools to promote depression self-management, drawing on evidence-based psychotherapies such
            as CBT, BA, and mindfulness. Some DHIs specifically address MDD and are designed to supplement clinical care
            while others aim to be a substitute for in-person care. Other DHIs target nonspecific depression/anxiety
            symptoms, stress, or burnout, which may indirectly benefit MDD. DHIs are potentially useful for individuals
            with mild to moderate severity of depressive symptoms; however, symptoms of severe depression, such as poor
            motivation and cognitive dysfunction, may interfere with an individual's ability to use DHIs.</p>
        <p>The potential advantages of DHIs include access to treatment at times and places that are convenient for the
            user, provision of feedback to the user in real-time, and customization of interventions for specific
            populations and in different languages, e.g., children and youth, people with nonpsychiatric medical
            conditions, postpartum users, ethnocultural groups, etc. Hence, DHIs may offer a resource that can
            complement and build a more engaged and accessible mental health care system.</p>
        <p>However, the clinical use of DHIs also poses many challenges. Few DHIs are rigorously evaluated for efficacy
            and safety. Privacy and security issues are often inadequately safeguarded. User engagement with DHIs
            decreases over time, e.g., less than one-third of individuals with depression are still using a DHI after 6
            weeks. Access to DHIs may also be impeded by the “digital divide” or digital inequity factors, e.g., low
            digital literacy, inability to purchase a computer or mobile device, and lack of internet access. Hence,
            addressing the digital divide is important for people with MDD. Mental health clinicians also need training
            in digital literacy and how to assess, recommend, and use DHIs with their patients.</p>

    <section id="section6B-07067437241245384">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs?</h3>
        <p>Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they
            often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available
            DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize
            popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal
            health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not
            necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of
            commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.</p>
        <p>Without guidance from clinicians, patients may self-select potentially inappropriate or unsafe DHIs. <a
                href="#table17-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 4.1</a> summarizes important questions to help
            clinicians evaluate DHIs for clinical use with their patients. Efficacy is the most important consideration.
            However, of the tens of thousands of DHIs that are commercially available, few are developed with an
            evidence-based framework and even fewer have undergone rigorous trials in the targeted population. In the
            absence of RCTs, other evidence for effectiveness may be informative, e.g., observational studies, studies
            in nonclinical populations, developer identity (commercial vs. health care), and alignment of features and
            content with evidence-based therapies.</p>

        <p>Data privacy and security are paramount for DHIs, but many have unclear or inaccurate privacy/security
            policies, and data are often shared with or sold to third parties. DHIs are more likely to be trustworthy if
            they have a clear privacy policy, guarantee to keep data anonymous, offer data security measures including
            password protection, explicitly state they will not sell data to third parties, and allow users to delete or
            opt out of data collection entirely. Other privacy risks should also be considered, e.g., risk of unwanted
            disclosure if a mobile app has a diagnosis in its title. Clinicians should also consult their regulatory
            bodies for up-to-date guidance on the evaluation and use of DHIs.</p>
        <p>There may also be potential harms from the use of mental health DHIs, especially in vulnerable individuals.
            For example, daily mood monitoring and reminders for depression management may exacerbate depressive
            symptoms and heighten their salience in individuals with self-stigma or unresolved grief about their
            diagnosis. DHIs should include clear procedures to follow when user responses indicate severe distress, such
            as information on crisis lines. DHIs offering peer support may carry risks, such as the exchange of
            inaccurate or harmful information, interpersonal conflict, and unwanted disclosure of personal information.
            Some of these risks can be mitigated by features including therapist moderation of support groups,
            peer-developed content that can be reviewed for accuracy, and the ability to participate anonymously if
            desired.</p>
        <p>Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or
            language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as
            subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a
            depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with
            patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps
            to identify features which may support DHI use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking
            integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make
            sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.</p>
        <p>Clinicians and patients can also utilize standardized frameworks for DHI evaluation. The nonprofit website
            Mindtools.io offers star-rating app reviews using the Enlight scale, which considers content and user
            engagement. The Division of Digital Psychiatry at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center created the
            M-Health Index and Navigation Database (MIND), a database which allows users to evaluate apps providing
            specific features for their needs.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.4.c. What is the Difference Between Guided and Unguided DHIs?</h3>
        <p>Unguided (i.e., self-directed) DHIs are programs in which the user engages independently, without help or
            contact with another person, whereas guided (or facilitated) DHIs are those where an individual supports the
            user to guide them through the program. Guides may be clinically trained (e.g., a CBT therapist) or equipped
            with technical knowledge of the DHI to encourage the user to complete the program (e.g., a lay coach or peer
            support person). Guidance can be synchronous (advice is given by the guide in real-time while the
            participant is using the DHI) or asynchronous (advice is provided when it is convenient for the guide to
            respond, e.g., by email or text). In some cases, guidance involves specific feedback on a user's responses
            to homework (e.g., a thought record) generated by the DHI. Guides are often helpful to motivate individuals
            to use and complete the program, thereby enhancing efficacy.</p>
        <p>In studies that compare self-directed and guided DHIs, all types of interventions are commonly grouped within
            a single guidance category of “guided” or “unguided.” This limitation conflates the efficacy of guided
            versus unguided DHIs with potential differences in efficacy within each group. Nonetheless, in these
            studies, guided DHIs are generally more effective than self-directed DHIs <img class="inline"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.4.d. What are Examples of Guided (Facilitated) DHIs?</h3>
        <p>Guided DHIs offer varying levels of person-facilitated support, ranging from 15  to 60 min per week, by
            trained therapists, peer supporters, or lay coaches. The format of guidance also varies, from telephone

        <p>The most-studied guided DHI approach is internet CBT (iCBT). These programs offer guidance from a therapist
            or are intended for use by clinicians working with their patients. A recent umbrella review of iCBT
            described medium to large effect sizes in 4 meta-analyses <img class="inline"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. The Good Days Ahead program, with therapist or telephone support,
            was evaluated in 2 large RCTs with evidence for efficacy. Some iCBT programs (e.g., Deprexis) also
            incorporate chatbot agents for conversational interaction with users. Hence, guided iCBT is recommended as a
            first-line monotherapy for mild depression <img class="inline"

        <p>There is also evidence for the efficacy of guided internet BA (iBA). A meta-analysis found that iBA for
            depression was superior to psychoeducation or treatment as usual, and noninferior to other behavioural
            therapy and mindfulness formats <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. However, 1 RCT of guided email support found no differences
            compared to a waitlist control condition. Because of this inconsistency, guided iBA is recommended as a
            second-line adjunctive treatment for mild–moderate MDD when supported by clinicians. Although other guided
            DHIs based on ACT, dialectical behavioural therapy, and mindfulness are being developed, there is
            insufficient evidence to recommend them.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs?</h3>
        <p>Prior to the advent of digital interventions, certain self-help books were prescribed in RCTs to have
            efficacy for MDD. Early DHIs adapted these into self-guided computer- and internet-delivered programs, which
            were essentially electronic self-help books providing basic psychoeducation and introducing key elements of
            CBT or BA. An example of this approach is MoodGym, which began in 2001 as a self-directed online course and
            has subsequently added numerous interactive exercises and questionnaires to engage the user with the
            learning material.</p>
        <p>There is limited evidence of efficacy for most self-directed DHIs. A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs found a
            moderate positive overall effect on depressive symptoms for smartphone-based DHIs versus control conditions,
            but there was no significant effect in the 2 RCTs involving participants with a diagnosis of MDD. Given the
            low level of evidence, CANMAT does not recommend routine use of self-directed DHIs as monotherapy for MDD,
            except in cases of mild severity when other resources are not available <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic"> (<a href="#table19-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table
                4.3</a>). Self-directed DHIs may be more useful when clinicians actively encourage patients to use and
            complete the program, hence, they are recommended as second-line adjunctive tools to usual clinical care
            when clinicians provide support and guidance <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. A pragmatic technique for the clinician acting as a guide is to
            periodically ask their patient if they have utilized the self-directed DHI, and if so, what they are
            learning.</p>
        <p>More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI) to provide interactive
            feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed
            with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that
            are generated by AI algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of
            interventions, such as CBT, through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy,
            understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early
            stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI systems. A
            recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had
            significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD and the
            results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias <img
                class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend
            chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD.</p>

    <section id="section7A-07067437241245384">
        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.5.a. What is Measurement-Based Care?</h3>
        <p>MBC is an evidence-based practice that uses routine outcome measurement and feedback to guide clinical
            decisions. Practically, MBC in psychiatry comprises 3 components: (a) regularly using validated outcome
            scales during patient encounters; (b) reviewing the scale scores with patients; and (c) using the scale
            scores alongside clinical assessment to support collaborative decision-making.</p>
        <p>Several high-quality trials and systematic reviews show that MBC improves medication adherence and outcomes,
            especially in the pharmacological treatment of MDD <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. MBC is also useful with psychotherapy, although many of the
            supporting studies involve mixed-diagnosis outpatient samples and use more general outcome measures, such as
            the outcome questionnaire. In these studies, MBC was associated with enhanced patient engagement, higher
            intervention accuracy, and shorter treatment duration <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Importantly, MBC can identify nonresponders who might need
            additional therapeutic techniques or sessions, or who would benefit from alternative treatments. Across
            treatment modalities, MBC can enhance the therapeutic alliance and facilitate SDM. Patients become active
            participants in monitoring their treatment, which helps them relate collaboratively with their care
            providers. For these reasons, the use of MBC is recommended in the management of MDD (<a

        <p>Many validated scales can be utilized for MBC to track various outcomes, e.g., symptoms, side effects,
            functioning, and quality of life (<a href="#table21-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 5.2</a>). For
            busy clinical settings, patient-rated scales (also called patient-rated outcome measures (PROMs)) are
            preferred because they are well-correlated with clinician-rated scales but take less time to administer.
            These PROMs can be supplemented by simple clinician-rated scales. Many are general scales that provide an
            overall severity measure, such as a total score. More detailed scales can be used to assess specific
            dimensions of depression, such as anhedonia, sleep, and cognition, when relevant. Some validated scales
            focus specifically on suicidal ideation and intent, with both clinician-rated (e.g., the Columbia Suicide
            Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]) and patient-rated (e.g., the Suicide Scale) scales available. Some patients
            find it easier to endorse suicidal thoughts on a questionnaire than face to face with a health practitioner.
            However, while scales can help assess suicidal ideation, they cannot reliably predict suicide attempts or
            behaviours. When scales for suicide risk are used, the results should be promptly reviewed and followed up
            with a clinical assessment if scores indicate risk.</p>

        <p>The use of scales for MBC is similar to the use of laboratory tests in that the results must be considered
            within the context of clinical assessment and care. There are many reasons why scale scores may not reflect
            a patient's clinical state. For example, the negative cognitive bias associated with MDD may interfere with
            accurate self-report, or some personality traits may contribute to chronic overreporting or underreporting
            on a symptom scale. Patients may also be concerned about over-reliance on a number and not their more
            complex issues.</p>
        <p>While MBC is largely intended to increase clinical objectivity, it can also provide insight into patients’
            subjective experiences. For example, when clinical evaluation varies substantially from patients’ symptom
            reporting, clinicians can use the discrepancies to explore individual factors that can colour patients’
            perceptions about symptoms. These discussions are likely to inform about patients’ cognitive schemas and can
            enhance therapeutic rapport. Hence, scales should complement, not replace, the clinical interview and the
            clinician's comprehensive understanding of the patient.</p>
        <p>MBC is also an integral component of collaborative care, where it serves as an essential means to communicate
            about a patient's clinical status and progress within the treatment team. MBC provides assessment continuity
            in settings where different providers manage the patient's care, e.g., when patients see different
            physicians at a clinic or where different providers manage medications and psychotherapy.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.5.b. What are Operational Definitions for Improvement, Response, and Remission?</h3>
        <p>Incorporating scales into clinical management can help detect early improvement, clinically significant
            change, and symptom remission. Furthermore, MBC can identify cases when patients are not responding
            adequately to treatment. Studies show that clinicians and patients may not always recognize a lack of
            response or remission, highlighting the limitations of relying on general impressions.</p>
        <p>Scales can be used to operationalize the definitions for improvement, response, and remission (discussed in
            Q.2). Early improvement is often defined with a symptom scale as a reduction in score of 20% or greater from
            baseline (within 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation), whereas response is defined as 50% or greater
            improvement from baseline. Symptom remission is indicated by a specific threshold score for each scale,
            e.g., a score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), 10 or less on the
            Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and 4 or less on the PHQ-9. Some definitions of remission
            also specify a minimum duration, e.g., the DSM-5 defines remission as the absence or near absence of
            symptoms for at least 2 months.</p>
        <p>MBC can be integrated into medication algorithms, with scale scores supporting clinical assessment and
            judgement for treatment decisions. For instance, lack of early improvement (i.e., less than 20% reduction in
            symptom scores at 2 to 4 weeks) after initiating an antidepressant is strongly associated with nonresponse
            and nonremission at later time points. Hence, a lack of early improvement by 4 weeks would trigger
            consideration of increasing the dose or switching the medication <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">.</p>
        <p>While the total score on a scale is a useful proxy for overall severity, individual item scores may also be
            informative. For example, a total score of 4 on the PHQ-9 may indicate symptom remission, but a rating of 3
            on the insomnia item suggests that residual sleep issues should be addressed. By examining both total and
            individual item scores, clinicians can comprehensively assess symptom profiles and tailor treatments
            accordingly.</p>
        <p>The concept of recovery extends beyond symptom relief to include functional outcomes and quality of life.
            While there are few consensus definitions of response or remission in terms of overall functioning or
            quality of life, many validated scales measure changes in these important domains with defined mean scores
            for the general population (<a href="#table21-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 5.2</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.5.c. How is Measurement-Based Care Implemented?</h3>
        <p>Although recommended by quality agencies and clinical guidelines, many barriers still exist to limit the
            widespread adoption of MBC in clinical practice. Clinicians often feel that using MBC takes too much time
            and that discussing scales with patients takes time away from the clinical encounter. Clinicians also may
            perceive that scales do not capture important aspects of a clinical situation or that the act of completing
            scales may interfere with the therapeutic alliance. Other barriers to MBC implementation include
            insufficient training on scale usage and workflows, misbeliefs about the feasibility and efficacy of MBC,
            challenges with language and cultural barriers to using scales, and implementation and opportunity costs
            associated with changing workflows.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging these concerns, many of these perceived barriers can be addressed. Practical tips for
            incorporating MBC in clinical settings include using simple PROMs that are free of charge, emailing scales
            to patients to complete prior to their appointment, and having patients complete scales in the waiting room
            before the appointment. Mobile and internet apps are also available that allow patients to complete
            validated scales and track their scores on their own time. For example, Apple has integrated the PHQ-9 and
            GAD-7 into its Health mobile app, so that scores can be tracked alongside other health indicators.</p>
        <p>Scales for MBC can be helpful when administered every 2 to 4 weeks during the acute phase of treatment when
            active treatment decisions are being made. During the maintenance phase or chronic states of MDD, scales can
            be used less frequently so that patients do not become frustrated with repeated testing and scores that may
            not change. A key component of MBC involves longitudinally tracking scores from scales and questionnaires.
            The simplest approach is to document the total scores in the progress notes during each visit. Electronic
            medical records (EMRs) can be modified to track scores over time in the same way as laboratory results.
            Internet-based and mobile solutions for MBC are also available for clinical settings that do not have EMRs
            or where EMRs cannot be easily reconfigured.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment?</h3>
        <p>Routine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (<a
                href="#table20-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 5.1</a>), although some blood tests are
            indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline
            and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring
            should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to
            hyponatremia with antidepressants <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical
            antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored.
            For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium,
            creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical
            status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis
            is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.</p>
        <p>Weight gain is associated with MDD both as a symptom of illness and as a medication side effect. Therefore,
            regular monitoring of weight, glucose, and lipid profiles is recommended in patients taking medications
            associated with weight gain, according to obesity management guidelines <img class="inline"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.6.a. How is Remission Maintained?</h3>
        <p>Maintaining remission is an important goal, as the risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent
            depressive episode. For psychological treatments, booster sessions may be helpful to retain and encourage
            strategies to maintain remission. Similarly, optimizing pharmacotherapy and treatment adherence will help
            individuals stay well. This can be done by maintaining the lowest effective dose used to achieve remission
            and minimize side effects, and regularly monitoring for emerging symptoms and side effects using MBC.</p>
        <p>Attention to modifiable lifestyle factors, such as exercising regularly, avoiding substance misuse, adhering
            to a healthy diet, and having quality sleep, plays an important role in the prevention of depression (see
            Q.2.f). Finally, peer support, defined as giving and receiving help from individuals with lived experiences
            of mental illness, is a central element in recovery-oriented practices and can be delivered in various ways
            (e.g., individual, group, online, etc.). Alongside standard treatments, peer support interventions have a
            small but positive effect on personal recovery (living a satisfying and hopeful life) <img class="inline"

        <p>The 2016 CANMAT guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9
            months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending
            maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months
            <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain
            antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission (<a href="#table22-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Table 6.1</a>).</p>
        <p>Maintenance psychotherapy can also prevent relapse and recurrence. Several meta-analyses and a network
            meta-analysis show that various psychological treatments (CBT, MBCT, IPT, CBASP, and PST) are superior to
            control conditions at preventing depressive relapse, with comparable effects among the different types of
            psychotherapy <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Evidence also supports the use of booster sessions at regular
            intervals (e.g., 4 sessions over 12 months) as an effective strategy for relapse prevention with MBCT.
            Psychotherapy appears to be as effective as antidepressants for preventing recurrence and may confer
            longer-lasting benefits by helping patients acquire more adaptive coping strategies over time. As a result,
            psychological interventions should be considered as first-choice options for mild to moderate severity MDD.
        </p>
        <p>The sequential treatment model consists of adding or switching to psychotherapy in the maintenance phase,
            after a response to acute phase pharmacotherapy. Sequential treatment also has meta-analytic evidence for
            the prevention of recurrence, even when antidepressants are stopped. Adding psychotherapy (with CBT and its
            variations the best studied) also offers the benefits of treating residual symptoms and increasing
            psychological well-being and resilience. Pharmacotherapy and sequential treatment with psychotherapy are
            recommended especially for individuals with recurrent and severe MDEs, who carry a high risk of recurrence
            with monotherapy. For these cases, pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychotherapy treatment <img

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment?</h3>
        <p>While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will
            require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity (<a
                href="#table23-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 6.2</a>). Most risk factors are longitudinal
            and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan.
            A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during
            childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and
            greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some
            evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in
            which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual
            characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity
            to life stressors over time.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued?</h3>
        <p>Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants,
            especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea,
            imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally
            occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in
            severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of
            symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see <a href="#boxed-text3-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Box 6.1</a>). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and
            venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation
            symptoms. <a href="#table24-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 6.3</a> shows the risk of
            discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.</p>

            <h4 class="obj_head">Box 6.1.</h4>
            <p>Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.</p>
            <p>Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6
                weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates
                in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with
                overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted
                discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums,
                more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.</p>
            <p>It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may
                still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may
                contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount
                (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed
                percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this
                approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers
                of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in
                clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated
                nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient
                evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.</p>

        <p>It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since
            misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms
            generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms
            (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive
            episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of
            antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to
            abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant
            discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of
            relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.</p>
        <p>However, there is no consensus on the best strategy for stopping antidepressants. Few relapse prevention
            studies have systematically differentiated discontinuation symptoms from symptoms of recurrence, and fewer
            have investigated strategies for stopping antidepressants. A 2021 Cochrane review examined the effectiveness
            of different approaches to discontinuing long-term antidepressants, including abrupt discontinuation, and
            tapering the antidepressant with or without psychological support. There was no clear evidence to support
            abrupt or tapering schedules. There is low-quality evidence that providing psychological support (primarily
            CBT or MBCT) is beneficial while tapering. All these results had low certainty because of the methodological
            limitations of the included studies. A hyperbolic tapering schedule has been suggested but there is
            insufficient evidence for its efficacy (see <a href="#boxed-text3-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Box
                6.1</a>).</p>
        <p>Given the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there
            are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.),
            antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does
            not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end
            of the taper <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4
            weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2
            weeks or less can be used <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding
            antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate
            discontinuation effects <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased,
            patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently.
            Alternatively, SSRI and SNRI antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine,
            which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated
            measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale <img class="inline"

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment?</h3>
        <p>In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD achieve response (&gt;50% reduction in
            symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom
            remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach
            remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve
            remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a
            common clinical challenge.</p>
        <p>Several clinical, comorbidity, and medication factors may contribute to insufficient treatment response (<a
                href="#table25-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 7.1</a>). Comorbid psychiatric conditions
            associated with poor treatment response include anxiety disorders, ADHD, post-traumatic stress disorder,
            substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Comorbid nonpsychiatric medical conditions may also be
            associated with poor response to antidepressants. For example, undiagnosed sleep apnea may be an important
            contributor to persistent residual symptoms of insomnia, fatigue, and low motivation. Clinicians should also
            be aware that comorbid conditions do not remain static over time. Hence, regular reassessment is important
            for patients with persistent symptoms.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.b. What is the Difference Between Treatment-Resistant Depression and
            Difficult-to-Treat Depression?</h3>
        <p>“Treatment-resistant depression (TRD)” is a term used to describe a lack of response to initial treatments.
            There is no universal consensus on a definition for TRD, but the one most frequently used is failure to
            respond to 2 or more antidepressant trials at a therapeutic dose and adequate duration. This definition has
            been criticized because it neglects psychological and neurostimulation treatments, it assumes that switching
            antidepressants is the preferred initial strategy and neglects add-on strategies. Furthermore, “failure” is
            often not defined or defined differently from study to study, and it does not account for partial response
            or residual symptoms. Additionally, the term “resistant” has a negative connotation which suggests futility
            and may discourage patients and clinicians from further therapeutic interventions.</p>
        <p>DTD is a term proposed to extend the TRD concept and to better characterize the collaborative journey of
            patients and their clinicians when standard treatments have not been effective. In the DTD model, the
            therapeutic focus shifts away from symptom remission towards symptom management, to achieve the best
            possible improvement in patient-prioritized outcomes such as functioning and quality of life. In the
            academic literature, DTD is used to describe persistent depression that has failed numerous standard
            treatments (in contrast to the minimum of 2 antidepressants defined by TRD) and is further along the
            treatment trajectory. In addition, compared to the term TRD, patients find DTD to be a more supportive,
            hopeful, and collaborative term. Hence, in these guidelines, we will use DTD as a holistic framework when
            discussing unsatisfactory responses to standard treatments and typically defined TRD when discussing
            medication options or studies that use the term.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial
            Antidepressant Treatment? </h3>
        <p>The first steps in the assessment of poor response involve re-evaluating the diagnosis (e.g., a missed
            diagnosis of bipolar disorder), comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. In addition to clinical
            reassessment, laboratory investigations should be considered to rule out potential medical factors that can
            contribute to persistent symptoms and that require additional interventions. Pharmacogenetic testing may be
            helpful to identify pharmacokinetic reasons for poor response or unusual severity of adverse effects.
            Systematic, sequential, and MBC may enhance outcomes for MDD when initial treatments are not fully effective

        <p>Strategies for poor response to an initial antidepressant include optimizing the dose, switching to another
            antidepressant, adding an adjunctive medication, and incorporating psychological and/or neuromodulation
            treatments. Given the limited evidence, CANMAT recommends that the sequencing of treatments should be based
            on a collaborative approach that integrates prior treatment history, the strength of the evidence for
            efficacy, potential for adverse events, and patient preference <img class="inline"

            <p>Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.</p>
            <p class="font-xs text-right text-italic" aria-label="Attribution"><em>Note.</em> This algorithm refers
                primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered
                when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table
                8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for
                treatment-resistant depression). DTD = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD = major depressive disorder;
                TCA = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD = treatment-resistant depression;
                XR = extended release.</p>
        </figure>
        <p>Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more
            effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated <img
                class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced
            against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.</p>
        <p>After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding
            an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent.
            Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one <img
                class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic"> and there appears to be diminishing response rates for
            antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.</p>
        <p>Adjunctive strategies, especially with atypical antipsychotic agents (serotonin and dopamine activity
            modulators), have greater evidence for efficacy and shorter time to response or remission, but they
            generally have a greater side effect burden than antidepressant monotherapy <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Moreover, RCTs directly comparing switching to adjunctive
            strategies have shown that adjunctive strategies have superior outcomes and often similar tolerability.
            Hence, while balancing individual risks, benefits, and patient preference, CANMAT recommends that adjunctive
            strategies be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm, after limited response to the first or second
            antidepressant trial <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"

        <p>For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects
            experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be
            considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has
            troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response
            to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? </h3>
        <p>Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the
            first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is
            not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that
            point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are
            tolerability concerns.</p>
        <p>When switching, selecting a second antidepressant should consider factors such as side effect profiles,
            mechanism of action, and comparative efficacy (see Q.3.d). Several studies have shown that there is no
            difference in outcome between switching within a medication class and switching to a different class. Hence,
            when switching to another antidepressant, CANMAT recommends first selecting a first-line antidepressant with
            evidence for superior efficacy and a favourable tolerability profile <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"

                3.5</a>). Of note is that TCA and MAOI agents may be useful in the treatment algorithm if there has been
            a poor response to first and/or second-line antidepressants (<a href="#boxed-text4-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Box 7.1</a>).</p>
        <p>The procedure for switching medications should be influenced by the likelihood of discontinuation effects,
            urgency of switching, and potential drug interactions. For most situations, given the low risk of drug
            interactions and side effects, the crossover “X” switch method can be used, i.e., slowly tapering the first
            medication while slowly titrating up the second <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. If there is less urgency for a switch, or a history of problems
            with discontinuation symptoms (see Q.6), or to avoid conflating discontinuation symptoms from new side
            effects, the washout “V” method can be used, i.e., tapering and discontinuing the first medication before
            starting the second <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Switching to MAOIs requires at least 2 weeks’ washout from other
            serotonergic medications (5 weeks if switching from fluoxetine). Online tools are also available for advice
            on titration and switching schedules (e.g., SwitchRx.com).</p>

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.e. What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? </h3>
        <p>Adding an adjunctive agent retains partial treatment gains from the initial antidepressant, avoids
            discontinuation symptoms from stopping the first medication, and potentially adds complementary mechanisms
            of action that have a faster onset of response. These benefits are especially helpful when there has been a
            partial response to the first antidepressant, and it is well tolerated. Adding another medication may also
            target specific residual symptoms or side effects from the initial antidepressant.</p>
        <p>The drawbacks of adjunctive treatments include the possibility of additive side effects, increased cost of
            treatment, and potential for drug–drug interactions <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/68e56cd87632/10.1177_07067437241245384-img4.jpg"

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. It should be noted, however, that adding an adjunctive agent at a
            low dose may accrue fewer side effects than increasing a single medication to higher doses <img

                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Finally, there is little evidence available for maintenance

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.7.f. How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected?</h3>
        <p>Selecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the
            adjunctive agent (<a href="#table26-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 7.2</a>) and the continued
            antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential
            drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may
            help in treatment selection, especially in DTD <img class="inline"
                src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/5be38aafe33f/10.1177_07067437241245384-img3.jpg"
                loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which
            can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a
            sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this
            strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as
            possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.</p>

            <h4 class="pmc_sec_title">Serotonin-Dopamine Activity Modulators (Low-Dose Atypical Antipsychotics)</h4>
            <p>Adjunctive treatment with serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (also known as atypical antipsychotic
                agents) has the most consistent evidence for efficacy in DTD (<a href="#table26-07067437241245384"
                    class="usa-link">Table 7.2</a>). Typically, lower doses of these medications are used for adjunctive
                treatment in MDD compared to other conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Most of the
                listed medications have evidence for efficacy, with network meta-analyses showing that they are more
                efficacious than placebo <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                    loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Aripiprazole and brexpiprazole are listed as first-line agents
                because of their efficacy and tolerability profile. Cariprazine is recommended as the second-line
                because there are fewer studies compared to the other agents. Ziprasidone is included as a third-line
                recommendation because of mixed efficacy results in RCTs and network meta-analyses.</p>
            <p>Serotonin-dopamine modulating agents have very different receptor and side effect profiles. Common side
                effects with aripiprazole and brexpiprazole include akathisia and weight gain. Some agents with Level 1
                evidence for efficacy are recommended as second-line treatments because of the increased risk of certain
                side effects, including olanzapine (weight gain and metabolic side effects), quetiapine-XR (sedation and
                metabolic side effects), and risperidone (hyperprolactinemia, sexual side effects, and extrapyramidal
                symptoms).</p>
            <p>There are also potential long-term risks with these medications, such as tardive dyskinesia, although the
                risk is lower compared to older antipsychotics and is mitigated by the lower dosing used for MDD. In
                studies of conditions other than MDD, long-term use of these agents in older age may be associated with
                increased mortality. Inconsistent reports also suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer,
                although the latter may also be mitigated by lower dosing and using prolactin-sparing agents.</p>

            <p>Compared to serotonin-dopamine activity-modulating agents, antidepressants generally have a more
                favourable side effect profile when used as adjunctive treatment, but the evidence for efficacy is less
                robust. Meta-analyses find that adding a second antidepressant is associated with better treatment
                outcomes compared to switching, but there is significant heterogeneity across reports which limits
                confidence in the results <img class="inline"

                α2-adrenoceptors) is superior to other combinations. Large RCTs have shown evidence for the
                effectiveness of adjunctive bupropion but the meta-analyses are inconclusive. Hence, these are
                recommended as second-line treatments for DTD. Adjunctive use of other antidepressants, including TCAs,
                continues to be recommended as a third line due to limited evidence and safety/tolerability issues among
                older agents.</p>

            <p>Methylphenidate and other stimulants have been studied for the treatment of MDD with mixed results.
                Outcomes differ widely across stimulants when used as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment and a network
                meta-analysis found mixed efficacy results. Side effects of stimulants include anxiety, irritability,
                jitteriness and tremors, headaches, insomnia, and appetite/weight loss. Additionally, tolerance may
                develop so that early improvements (especially in domains of energy, motivation, and cognition) may

            <p>Lithium and triiodothyronine were listed as second-line adjunctive agents in the CANMAT 2016 guidelines.
                Both medications were included in a network meta-analysis evaluating all adjunctive options. While both
                lithium and triiodothyronine had evidence for efficacy, the included RCTs predated 2003, had small
                sample sizes and involved adjunctive use with TCAs only. Lithium also requires serum level monitoring
                and triiodothyronine requires monitoring of thyroid levels. Hence, lithium and triiodothyronine continue

            <p>Adjunctive use of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, was shown to have both acute and longer-term
                antidepressant effects in a meta-analysis of MDD and bipolar depression. In small-sample RCTs, patients

        <p>There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane
            review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence
            supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT) added to usual care (including
            antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates <img

            <h4 class="pmc_sec_title">Electroconvulsive Therapy</h4>
            <p>ECT involves the delivery of an electrical stimulus via electrodes placed on the scalp, resulting in the
                induction of a brief generalized seizure. ECT is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle
                relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential
                complications. ECT remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD. However,
                the clinical use of ECT is often hindered by stigma, the need for general anaesthesia, concern about
                cognitive adverse effects, and high rates of relapse after acute treatment.</p>
            <p>ECT has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with
                response rates ranging from 65% to 75% <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/62befe587468/10.1177_07067437241245384-img1.jpg"
                    loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. ECT may be especially effective in older patients, those with
                psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of
                retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT outweigh the risks among hospitalized
                MDD patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT
                significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.</p>
            <p>An acute course of ECT usually requires 6 to 12 sessions, with no difference in response outcomes between
                sessions given twice or thrice weekly <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                    loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. Refinements in the delivery of ECT have focused on electrode
                placement and stimulus energy, based on the waveform of electrical stimulus and seizure threshold (the
                minimum amount of current required to produce a measurable seizure) (<a
                    href="#table27-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 8.1</a>). Ultrabrief pulse (∼0.3 ms)
                waveforms with right unilateral electrode placement are slightly less effective than brief pulse (∼1.0
                ms) but appear to have fewer cognitive adverse effects (see below). In contrast, bitemporal brief pulse
                ECT may have greater efficacy than other protocols but carries a higher cognitive burden. Furthermore,
                large-scale studies have demonstrated superior quality of life outcomes for right unilateral positioning
                compared to either bitemporal or bifrontal positioning. Hence, both efficacy and tolerability should be
                considered when choosing an ECT protocol for a particular patient.</p>

                during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials.
                Ketamine has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT, whether as an anaesthetic agent or with
                single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT. Some concomitant medications may interfere with
                ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects
                (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.</p>
            <p>ECT is generally safe and well tolerated. Rates of cardiac events and mortality associated with ECT are
                very low and similar to the risks for general anaesthesia. Adverse effects on cognition are of most
                concern, although modern ECT techniques, including unilateral electrode placement and refined electrical
                dosing, have reduced both the incidence and severity of cognitive side effects. Cognitive effects
                experienced immediately following an ECT session include transient disorientation, confusion, and memory
                lapses, particularly anterograde amnesia for events surrounding the treatment period. These effects
                typically resolve within days to weeks. While there is potential for long-term cognitive effects,
                particularly retrograde amnesia for events remote to ECT, recent meta-analyses of neuropsychological
                assessments demonstrate that cognitive performance is unchanged or improved at least 1 month after a
                course of ECT. Nevertheless, some patients report significant and distressing gaps in autobiographical
                memory long after ECT, and the discrepancy between cognitive performance and subjective memory
                dysfunction remains controversial. Of note is that subjective cognitive dysfunction is commonly
                experienced during an acute episode of MDD and is associated with persisting depressive symptoms.</p>
            <p>Although ECT has high response rates during acute treatment, recurrence occurs in 60% to 80% of patients
                at 6-month follow-up. Given the high recurrence rate, a maintenance strategy should be implemented
                following ECT, with either pharmacotherapy or continuation ECT. Unfortunately, there is only limited
                data to guide this treatment choice. Continuation ECT (administered at increasing intervals from once a
                week to once a month) shows better efficacy in preventing recurrence after ECT, compared to maintenance
                pharmacotherapy <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                    loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. However, few medications have been systematically studied for
                maintenance pharmacotherapy. Lithium, when combined with either nortriptyline or venlafaxine-XR, is
                shown to be superior for relapse prevention compared to either antidepressant alone <img class="inline"
                    src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/843a/11351064/b9ea5ad77490/10.1177_07067437241245384-img2.jpg"
                    loading="lazy" alt="Inline graphic">. There are no differences in cognitive outcomes between
                maintenance ECT and pharmacotherapy. Given this limited evidence, the choice for maintenance treatment
                following successful ECT must consider factors such as previous ECT responses, episode severity and
                degree of treatment resistance, consequences of recurrence, adverse effects experienced during ECT, and
                patient preference.</p>

        <p>Surgical neuromodulation treatments offer the capability of “always-on” electrical stimulation to change the
            function of neural targets specifically and selectively (e.g., nodes in the neural circuit) that are
            inaccessible by noninvasive methods. Stimulus parameters can also be individually and continuously adjusted
            to either modulate the node (i.e., change the node function) or to ablate it (i.e., remove the node from the

            <p>VNS involves surgically implanting an electrode around the left vagus nerve in the mid-cervical region of
                the neck, connected to a pulse generator implanted subcutaneously in the chest wall. Low-level
                intermittent electrical stimulation of the left vagus nerve is believed to stimulate the nucleus tractus
                solitarius and its cortical and subcortical connections to achieve antidepressant effects. The VNS
                procedure was first approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of epilepsy, and subsequently for
                TRD in Canada (2001) and the United States (2005).</p>
            <p>To date, there are very few RCTs involving VNS, and these studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy
                of VNS compared to sham control conditions in the short term. However, systematic reviews of open-label
                studies in patients with DTD suggest that longer-term treatment (2 to 5 years) with VNS results in
                superior response and remission rates compared to treatment-as-usual cohorts 6. VNS is generally safe
                and well tolerated, with the most common side effects involving pain related to device implantation,
                voice hoarseness or alteration (due to intermittent stimulation of the larynx), coughing, headache, sore

            <p>DBS involves neurosurgical implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions, connected to a

                capsule, and the medial forebrain bundle.</p>
            <p>Given that DBS involves a neurosurgical procedure, most studies in MDD have small sample sizes and

        <h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Q.8.d. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Selected?</h3>
        <p>Generally, noninvasive neuromodulation treatments are safe and well tolerated. Notably, ECT is more
            efficacious for DTD compared to other noninvasive neuromodulation treatments, although it carries a greater
            side effect burden. However, rTMS is typically recommended for patients with TRD (and ECT for DTD) after the
            failure of first-line psychotherapy and medication treatments (<a href="#table29-07067437241245384"
                class="usa-link">Table 8.3</a>) because of feasibility issues, including limited availability
            (especially in the public health sector), patient burden (e.g., requiring daily clinic visits for rTMS), and
            the need for specialized personnel (e.g., anaesthesiologists for ECT). Although tDCS has evidence of
            efficacy, given the limited information on treatment parameters and the negative results from recent large
            RCTs, it has been downgraded to a third-line recommendation for MDD <img class="inline"

        <p>In some clinical situations, noninvasive neuromodulation treatments can be considered as first-choice
            treatments for MDD. For example, ECT can be used as first-line treatment in severe illness (e.g., MDE with
            psychotic or catatonic features, severe suicidal ideation, and deteriorating physical condition) or for
            patients who had a prior good response to ECT. Similarly, rTMS can be recommended as a first-choice
            treatment if there are tolerability concerns with medication options or if it was effective in a previous
            episode. Finally, except in emergent situations as mentioned above, rTMS should generally be considered
            before ECT, given its less invasive nature and that individuals may continue to work or attend school while
            undergoing rTMS. Although some studies show that prior poor response to ECT is associated with poor response
            to rTMS, other studies do not.</p>
        <p>Given the lower level of evidence for efficacy and the greater associated risks, surgical neuromodulation
            treatments should generally be considered after noninvasive neuromodulation treatments. Currently, VNS is
            the only surgical neuromodulation treatment approved for TRD by regulatory agencies and is recommended as a
            third-line option (<a href="#table29-07067437241245384" class="usa-link">Table 8.3</a>). DBS and MST are
            currently considered investigational due to limited available evidence.</p>
