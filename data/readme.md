- `guideline_db.json` is the processed guideline file that serve as our knowledge base
- `original_html.html` is the original website page
- `source.html` is the file that's been cleaned up for data_processing
- `source_formatted_with_tabs` is the same as source but formatted so that it's easier to read. But after formatting there are tabs, which might affect parsing. So we don't use it.
