If discontinuationsymptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients canreturn to the previous higher dose, with a slower taperingschedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI and SNRIantidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication suchas fluoxetine, which can then be tapered.

Given the high recurrence rate, a maintenancestrategy should be implemented following ECT, with eitherpharmacotherapy or continuation ECT. Unfortunately, there isonly limited data to guide this treatment choice.Continuation ECT (administered at increasing intervals fromonce a week to once a month) shows better efficacy inpreventing recurrence after ECT, compared to maintenancepharmacotherapy (Level 2). However, fewmedications have been systematically studied for maintenancepharmacotherapy. Lithium, when combined with eithernortriptyline or venlafaxine-XR, is shown to be superior forrelapse prevention compared to either antidepressant alone(Level 2). There are nodifferences in cognitive outcomes between maintenance ECTand pharmacotherapy. Given this limited evidence, the choicefor maintenance treatment following successful ECT mustconsider factors such as previous ECT responses, episodeseverity and degree of treatment resistance, consequences ofrecurrence, adverse effects experienced during ECT, andpatient preference.",
