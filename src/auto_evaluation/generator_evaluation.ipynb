What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 216\\n\\nAn acute course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) usually requires 6 to 12 sessions, with no difference in response outcomes between sessions given twice or thrice weekly (Level 2) . Refinements in the delivery of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) have focused on electrode placement and stimulus energy, based on the waveform of electrical stimulus and seizure threshold (the minimum amount of current required to produce a measurable seizure) ( Table 8.1 ). Ultrabrief pulse (∼0.3 ms) waveforms with right unilateral electrode placement are slightly less effective than brief pulse (∼1.0 ms) but appear to have fewer cognitive adverse effects (see below). In contrast, bitemporal brief pulse ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may have greater efficacy than other protocols but carries a higher cognitive burden. Furthermore, large-scale studies have demonstrated superior quality of life outcomes for right unilateral positioning compared to either bitemporal or bifrontal positioning. Hence, both efficacy and tolerability should be considered when choosing an ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) protocol for a particular patient.\\n\\nQuestion 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 214\\n\\nECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) involves the delivery of an electrical stimulus via electrodes placed on the scalp, resulting in the induction of a brief generalized seizure. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression). However, the clinical use of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is often hindered by stigma, the need for general anaesthesia, concern about cognitive adverse effects, and high rates of relapse after acute treatment.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression).

Rates of cardiac events and mortality associated with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) are very low and similar to the risks for general anaesthesia. Adverse effects on cognition are of most concern, although modern ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) techniques, including unilateral electrode placement and refined electrical dosing, have reduced both the incidence and severity of cognitive side effects. Cognitive effects experienced immediately following an ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) session include transient disorientation, confusion, and memory lapses, particularly anterograde amnesia for events surrounding the treatment period. These effects typically resolve within days to weeks. While there is potential for long-term cognitive effects, particularly retrograde amnesia for events remote to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), recent meta-analyses of neuropsychological assessments demonstrate that cognitive performance is unchanged or improved at least 1 month after a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Nevertheless, some patients report significant and distressing gaps in autobiographical memory long after ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), and the discrepancy between cognitive performance and subjective memory dysfunction remains controversial. Of note is that subjective cognitive dysfunction is commonly experienced during an acute episode of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and is associated with persisting depressive symptoms.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

Refinements in the delivery of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) have focused on electrode placement and stimulus energy, based on the waveform of electrical stimulus and seizure threshold (the minimum amount of current required to produce a measurable seizure) ( Table 8.1 ). Ultrabrief pulse (∼0.3 ms) waveforms with right unilateral electrode placement are slightly less effective than brief pulse (∼1.0 ms) but appear to have fewer cognitive adverse effects (see below). In contrast, bitemporal brief pulse ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may have greater efficacy than other protocols but carries a higher cognitive burden. Furthermore, large-scale studies have demonstrated superior quality of life outcomes for right unilateral positioning compared to either bitemporal or bifrontal positioning. Hence, both efficacy and tolerability should be considered when choosing an ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) protocol for a particular patient.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 219\\n\\nECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is generally safe and well tolerated. Rates of cardiac events and mortality associated with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) are very low and similar to the risks for general anaesthesia. Adverse effects on cognition are of most concern, although modern ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) techniques, including unilateral electrode placement and refined electrical dosing, have reduced both the incidence and severity of cognitive side effects. Cognitive effects experienced immediately following an ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) session include transient disorientation, confusion, and memory lapses, particularly anterograde amnesia for events surrounding the treatment period. These effects typically resolve within days to weeks. While there is potential for long-term cognitive effects, particularly retrograde amnesia for events remote to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), recent meta-analyses of neuropsychological assessments demonstrate that cognitive performance is unchanged or improved at least 1 month after a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Nevertheless, some patients report significant and distressing gaps in autobiographical memory long after ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), and the discrepancy between cognitive performance and subjective memory dysfunction remains controversial. Of note is that subjective cognitive dysfunction is commonly experienced during an acute episode of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and is associated with persisting depressive symptoms.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression). However, the clinical use of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is often hindered by stigma, the need for general anaesthesia, concern about cognitive adverse effects, and high rates of relapse after acute treatment.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Intermittent TBS (Theta burst stimulation) (iTBS) consists of 2 s trains of TBS (Theta burst stimulation) repeated every 10\\u2005s for a total of 190\\u2005s (just over 3\\u2005min), which is thought to increase cortical excitability, while continuous TBS (Theta burst stimulation) (cTBS) consists of a continuous 40 s train, which is believed to decrease cortical excitability. TBS (Theta burst stimulation) is recommended as a first-line protocol (Level 1) ( Table 8.2 ). A noninferiority study found that iTBS was as effective and tolerated as high-frequency rTMS but with the advantage of significantly shorter daily treatment sessions. Newer TBS (Theta burst stimulation) protocols use accelerated delivery, with and without individualized functional MRI targeting, with multiple treatment sessions given each day to reduce the overall duration of a treatment course to as short as 5 days. Accelerated iTBS to the left DLPFC (Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) has evidence for efficacy (Level 3) and a large RCT (Randomized controlled trial) found no significant differences between accelerated bilateral TBS (Theta burst stimulation) and high frequency rTMS.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

However, systematic reviews of open-label studies in patients with DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) suggest that longer-term treatment (2 to 5 years) with VNS (Vagus nerve stimulation) results in superior response and remission rates compared to treatment-as-usual cohorts 6. VNS (Vagus nerve stimulation) is generally safe and well tolerated, with the most common side effects involving pain related to device implantation, voice hoarseness or alteration (due to intermittent stimulation of the larynx), coughing, headache, sore throat, and neck pain.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

Low-level intermittent electrical stimulation of the left vagus nerve is believed to stimulate the nucleus tractus solitarius and its cortical and subcortical connections to achieve antidepressant effects. The VNS (Vagus nerve stimulation) procedure was first approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of epilepsy, and subsequently for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) in Canada (2001) and the United States (2005).\\n\\nQuestion 7.

Common side effects with aripiprazole and brexpiprazole include akathisia and weight gain. Some agents with Level 1 evidence for efficacy are recommended as second-line treatments because of the increased risk of certain side effects, including olanzapine (weight gain and metabolic side effects), quetiapine-XR (sedation and metabolic side effects), and risperidone (hyperprolactinemia, sexual side effects, and extrapyramidal symptoms).',\n",

What Surgical Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Deep Brain Stimulation > paragraph id: 232\\n\\nGiven that DBS (Deep brain stimulation) involves a neurosurgical procedure, most studies in MDD (Major depressive disorder) have small sample sizes and involve patients with highly refractory illnesses, including ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) nonresponders. Open-label clinical studies of DBS (Deep brain stimulation) demonstrate high response rates in participants with DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) across several targets. However, a sham-controlled RCT (Randomized controlled trial) of DBS (Deep brain stimulation) targeting the subcallosal cingulate cortex did not show efficacy after 6 months of blinded treatment. Longer-term observational studies suggest that, like VNS (Vagus nerve stimulation), the therapeutic effects of DBS (Deep brain stimulation) increase over time (Level 3) . In addition to transient side effects associated with stimulation, several studies have reported serious adverse events related to neurosurgery implantation.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

What Surgical Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Deep Brain Stimulation > paragraph id: 231\\n\\nDBS (Deep brain stimulation) involves neurosurgical implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions, connected to a subclavicular-implanted pulse generator delivering constant or intermittent electrical stimulation. The most frequently studied target for DBS (Deep brain stimulation) in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) is the subcallosal cingulate cortex, while other studied targets include the ventral capsule/striatum, the nucleus accumbens, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the medial forebrain bundle.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

High-frequency (5 Hz or higher) rTMS delivered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC (Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)) has the largest evidence base and is recommended as a first-line protocol, along with low-frequency (1 Hz or lower) rTMS delivered over the right DLPFC (Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Bilateral rTMS, targeting each DLPFC (Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) sequentially, is recommended as a second-line protocol but may be considered first-line for late-life depression. Clinical features associated with lower remission rates after rTMS include higher baseline severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and a greater number of previous antidepressant trial failures.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Magnetic Seizure Therapy > paragraph id: 227\\n\\nMST (Magnetic seizure therapy) was developed in part to mitigate the cognitive side effects of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Instead of direct electrical current, MST (Magnetic seizure therapy) uses vertex or frontal placement of single or paired circular coils to deliver TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation). The high intensity and frequency of TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) induces an electrical field that is strong enough to elicit a generalized seizure. MST (Magnetic seizure therapy) has shown promising results in small-sample RCTs, with similar efficacy to right unilateral, ultrabrief ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), but fewer adverse effects. However, without more definitive studies, MST (Magnetic seizure therapy) is still considered an investigational treatment (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation > paragraph id: 221\\n\\nrTMS involves stimulation of cortical neurons using powerful, focused magnetic field pulses that are externally applied over the scalp using a magnetic coil. Several coil shapes have been designed to improve targeting. Unlike ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), rTMS does not require anaesthesia and has no cognitive side effects. Depending on the protocol, conventional rTMS is delivered for 20 to 40\\u2005min each session, with daily sessions 5 days a week for 4 to 6 weeks. Parameters for rTMS include the type of coil, location of the scalp where the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation)) coil is placed (to direct the magnetic pulses to a specific cortical brain region), frequency of stimulation, and number and duration of magnetic pulses (trains).\\n\\nQuestion 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.d. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Selected? > paragraph id: 235\\n\\nIn some clinical situations, noninvasive neuromodulation treatments can be considered as first-choice treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder). For example, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) can be used as first-line treatment in severe illness (e.g., MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic or catatonic features, severe suicidal ideation, and deteriorating physical condition) or for patients who had a prior good response to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Similarly, rTMS can be recommended as a first-choice treatment if there are tolerability concerns with medication options or if it was effective in a previous episode. Finally, except in emergent situations as mentioned above, rTMS should generally be considered before ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), given its less invasive nature and that individuals may continue to work or attend school while undergoing rTMS. Although some studies show that prior poor response to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is associated with poor response to rTMS, other studies do not.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Refinements in the delivery of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) have focused on electrode placement and stimulus energy, based on the waveform of electrical stimulus and seizure threshold (the minimum amount of current required to produce a measurable seizure) ( Table 8.1 ). Ultrabrief pulse (∼0.3 ms) waveforms with right unilateral electrode placement are slightly less effective than brief pulse (∼1.0 ms) but appear to have fewer cognitive adverse effects (see below). In contrast, bitemporal brief pulse ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may have greater efficacy than other protocols but carries a higher cognitive burden. Furthermore, large-scale studies have demonstrated superior quality of life outcomes for right unilateral positioning compared to either bitemporal or bifrontal positioning. Hence, both efficacy and tolerability should be considered when choosing an ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) protocol for a particular patient.\\n\\nQuestion 8.

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression).

What is the Difference Between Treatment-Resistant Depression and Difficult-to-Treat Depression? > paragraph id: 182\\n\\n“Treatment-resistant depression (TRD (Treatment-resistant depression))” is a term used to describe a lack of response to initial treatments. There is no universal consensus on a definition for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression), but the one most frequently used is failure to respond to 2 or more antidepressant trials at a therapeutic dose and adequate duration. This definition has been criticized because it neglects psychological and neurostimulation treatments, it assumes that switching antidepressants is the preferred initial strategy and neglects add-on strategies. Furthermore, “failure” is often not defined or defined differently from study to study, and it does not account for partial response or residual symptoms. Additionally, the term “resistant” has a negative connotation which suggests futility and may discourage patients and clinicians from further therapeutic interventions.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 70\\n\\nThe choice of initial treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) is an important and consequential decision that should be made collaboratively between clinician and patient. Information sharing should include the range of potential treatments, the evidence supporting each, the nature and severity of depression, and the personal situation, expectations, and preferences of the patient. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations are based primarily on the severity of depression (see Conventions section for definitions of mild, moderate, and severe), but other factors, including treatment response in past episodes, patient preference and treatment availability, should also be considered ( Table 3.1 ).\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.b. What is the Difference Between Treatment-Resistant Depression and Difficult-to-Treat Depression? > paragraph id: 183\\n\\nDTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) is a term proposed to extend the TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) concept and to better characterize the collaborative journey of patients and their clinicians when standard treatments have not been effective. In the DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) model, the therapeutic focus shifts away from symptom remission towards symptom management, to achieve the best possible improvement in patient-prioritized outcomes such as functioning and quality of life. In the academic literature, DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) is used to describe persistent depression that has failed numerous standard treatments (in contrast to the minimum of 2 antidepressants defined by TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)) and is further along the treatment trajectory. In addition, compared to the term TRD (Treatment-resistant depression), patients find DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) to be a more supportive, hopeful, and collaborative term. Hence, in these guidelines, we will use DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) as a holistic framework when discussing unsatisfactory responses to standard treatments and typically defined TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) when discussing medication options or studies that use the term.\\n\\nQuestion 3.

What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? > paragraph id: 194\\n\\nAdding an adjunctive agent retains partial treatment gains from the initial antidepressant, avoids discontinuation symptoms from stopping the first medication, and potentially adds complementary mechanisms of action that have a faster onset of response. These benefits are especially helpful when there has been a partial response to the first antidepressant, and it is well tolerated. Adding another medication may also target specific residual symptoms or side effects from the initial antidepressant.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.f.

The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy.

What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Stimulants > paragraph id: 206\\n\\nMethylphenidate and other stimulants have been studied for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with mixed results. Outcomes differ widely across stimulants when used as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment and a network meta-analysis found mixed efficacy results. Side effects of stimulants include anxiety, irritability, jitteriness and tremors, headaches, insomnia, and appetite/weight loss. Additionally, tolerance may develop so that early improvements (especially in domains of energy, motivation, and cognition) may quickly wane over time. Consequently, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends stimulants as third-line adjunctive treatments (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.e. What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? > paragraph id: 195\\n\\nThe drawbacks of adjunctive treatments include the possibility of additive side effects, increased cost of treatment, and potential for drug–drug interactions (Level 4) . Furthermore, using multiple medications may contribute to decreased adherence to treatment (Level 4) . It should be noted, however, that adding an adjunctive agent at a low dose may accrue fewer side effects than increasing a single medication to higher doses (Level 3) . Finally, there is little evidence available for maintenance treatment with adjunctive agents, so it is unclear how long adjunctive medications should be continued.\\n\\nQuestion 7.

What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Serotonin-Dopamine Activity Modulators (Low-Dose Atypical Antipsychotics) > paragraph id: 198\\n\\nAdjunctive treatment with serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (also known as atypical antipsychotic agents) has the most consistent evidence for efficacy in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) ( Table 7.2 ). Typically, lower doses of these medications are used for adjunctive treatment in MDD (Major depressive disorder) compared to other conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Most of the listed medications have evidence for efficacy, with network meta-analyses showing that they are more efficacious than placebo (Level 1) . Aripiprazole and brexpiprazole are listed as first-line agents because of their efficacy and tolerability profile. Cariprazine is recommended as the second-line because there are fewer studies compared to the other agents. Ziprasidone is included as a third-line recommendation because of mixed efficacy results in RCTs and network meta-analyses.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Adding mirtazapine/mianserin (antagonists of presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors) is superior to other combinations. Large RCTs have shown evidence for the effectiveness of adjunctive bupropion but the meta-analyses are inconclusive. Hence, these are recommended as second-line treatments for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

A CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Task Force Report summarized the extensive evidence for rapid antidepressant effects of a single dose of intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine, a glutamate modulator acting as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist (Level 1) , with recent studies also showing effectiveness and safety of repeated infusions (Level 2) . Similarly, several meta-analyses showed efficacy for intranasal esketamine (Level 1) , which is approved by several regulatory agencies as an add-on treatment to an SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)/SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or other antidepressant, for patients failing at least 2 adequate antidepressant trials.\\n\\nQuestion 7.

There is also growing evidence for relapse-prevention efficacy for both medications, with maintenance doses administered every 1 to 4 weeks (Level 2) . However, side effect potential and feasibility issues (i.e., the required monitoring of blood pressure and dissociative side effects) have downgraded adjunctive ketamine and intranasal esketamine to second-line recommendation.\\n\\nQuestion 7.

However, the reported treatment protocols (dosage, frequency, formulation, etc.) are highly variable and results are mixed. Given these issues, alternate routes of administration of racemic ketamine are downgraded to third-line recommendation (Level 3) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 193\\n\\nThe procedure for switching medications should be influenced by the likelihood of discontinuation effects, urgency of switching, and potential drug interactions. For most situations, given the low risk of drug interactions and side effects, the crossover “X” switch method can be used, i.e., slowly tapering the first medication while slowly titrating up the second (Level 4) . If there is less urgency for a switch, or a history of problems with discontinuation symptoms (see Q.6), or to avoid conflating discontinuation symptoms from new side effects, the washout “V” method can be used, i.e., tapering and discontinuing the first medication before starting the second (Level 4) . Switching to MAOIs requires at least 2 weeks’ washout from other serotonergic medications (5 weeks if switching from fluoxetine). Online tools are also available for advice on titration and switching schedules (e.g., SwitchRx.com).\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 192\\n\\nWhen switching, selecting a second antidepressant should consider factors such as side effect profiles, mechanism of action, and comparative efficacy (see Q.3.d). Several studies have shown that there is no difference in outcome between switching within a medication class and switching to a different class. Hence, when switching to another antidepressant, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends first selecting a first-line antidepressant with evidence for superior efficacy and a favourable tolerability profile (Level 4) ( Table 3.5 ). Of note is that TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) and MAOI (Monoamine oxidase inhibitor) agents may be useful in the treatment algorithm if there has been a poor response to first and/or second-line antidepressants ( Box 7.1 ).\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 179\\n\\nGiven the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Some TCAs have a more favourable side effect profile than others. For example, nortriptyline has the fewest anticholinergic and hypotensive adverse effects; it has a good safety and efficacy profile in elderly and post-stroke depression populations.\\nThese older medications continue to have an important role in managing treatment-resistant depression (TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)) and difficult-to-treat depression (DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)). TCAs have evidence for superior efficacy in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and may have specificity for subpopulations of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder), e.g., amitriptyline for comorbid painful conditions and clomipramine for comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. Another advantage of TCAs is that, in contrast to newer antidepressants, serum levels can be informative to adjust dosing. MAOIs are also efficacious in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and have a different mechanism of action compared to first-line and second-line agents. Hence, TCAs and MAOIs should be considered as therapeutic options when first-line and second-line medication treatments are not effective, with patients monitored carefully for side effects and potential for drug interactions.',\n",

A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).\\n\\nQuestion 3.

Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) .

Several RCTs show efficacy for single-dose psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) (Level 2) . Although these results are promising, they are limited by ongoing methodological issues (e.g., lack of blinding, inadequate assessment of expectancy bias, heterogeneity of psychological support, and lack of long-term safety data).

For psychological treatments, booster sessions may be helpful to retain and encourage strategies to maintain remission. Similarly, optimizing pharmacotherapy and treatment adherence will help individuals stay well. This can be done by maintaining the lowest effective dose used to achieve remission and minimize side effects, and regularly monitoring for emerging symptoms and side effects using MBC (Measurement-based care).\\n\\nQuestion 6.

Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .\\n\\nQuestion 2.

Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.\\n\\nQuestion 6.

Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173\\n\\nWhile 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.\\n\\nQuestion 6.

A 2021 Cochrane review examined the effectiveness of different approaches to discontinuing long-term antidepressants, including abrupt discontinuation, and tapering the antidepressant with or without psychological support. There was no clear evidence to support abrupt or tapering schedules. There is low-quality evidence that providing psychological support (primarily CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) or MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)) is beneficial while tapering. All these results had low certainty because of the methodological limitations of the included studies.

Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

All these results had low certainty because of the methodological limitations of the included studies. A hyperbolic tapering schedule has been suggested but there is insufficient evidence for its efficacy (see Box 6.1 ).\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 179\\n\\nGiven the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177\\n\\nIt is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.\\nIt has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10\\u2005mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.',\n",

Clinicians also may perceive that scales do not capture important aspects of a clinical situation or that the act of completing scales may interfere with the therapeutic alliance.

For example, when clinical evaluation varies substantially from patients’ symptom reporting, clinicians can use the discrepancies to explore individual factors that can colour patients’ perceptions about symptoms.

              " 'Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.a. What is Measurement-Based Care? > paragraph id: 152\\n\\nMany validated scales can be utilized for MBC (Measurement-based care) to track various outcomes, e.g., symptoms, side effects, functioning, and quality of life ( Table 5.2 ). For busy clinical settings, patient-rated scales (also called patient-rated outcome measures (PROMs)) are preferred because they are well-correlated with clinician-rated scales but take less time to administer. These PROMs can be supplemented by simple clinician-rated scales. Many are general scales that provide an overall severity measure, such as a total score. More detailed scales can be used to assess specific dimensions of depression, such as anhedonia, sleep, and cognition, when relevant. Some validated scales focus specifically on suicidal ideation and intent, with both clinician-rated (e.g., the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]) and patient-rated (e.g., the Suicide Scale) scales available. Some patients find it easier to endorse suicidal thoughts on a questionnaire than face to face with a health practitioner. However, while scales can help assess suicidal ideation, they cannot reliably predict suicide attempts or behaviours. When scales for suicide risk are used, the results should be promptly reviewed and followed up with a clinical assessment if scores indicate risk.\\n\\nQuestion 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.c. How are Suicide and Safety Risks Managed? > paragraph id: 53\\n\\nSuicide risk assessment should be a routine part of psychiatric interviews, especially in emergency room settings, with the aim of making patients feel genuinely listened to and validated. The focus of the risk assessment in the psychiatric interview and subsequent risk formulation should be to understand the basis for suicidal ideation/behaviour, personal strengths and protective factors that can be leveraged for safety planning, and foreseeable changes ( Table 2.2 ). The assessment should identify potentially modifiable risk factors ( Table 2.2 ) because historical and demographic factors which are associated with overrepresentation in deaths by suicide (e.g., male sex, older age, family history of suicide, etc.) are not helpful for risk assessment. Validated suicide risk scales are available but they have low sensitivity and predictive power for suicide behaviours and should only be used alongside clinician judgment (see Q.5.a).\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.c. How is a Psychological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 81\\n\\nPsychotherapy is similarly effective across most demographic factors, including sex, age, level of education, culture, and ethnicity, hence these patient factors are not informative for choosing the initial psychotherapy. As for clinical factors, illness severity primarily affects the urgency with which the treatment must begin; the more severe the illness, the more imperative it is to start treatment as soon as possible to avert the risk of harm. The severity of MDE (Major depressive episode) does not predict outcomes in CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) versus pharmacotherapy; however, the combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment is more effective than either alone and should be considered in severe cases (see Q.3.b). Importantly, meta-analytic evidence suggests that CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) reduces suicide attempts by half in those who attempted suicide in the previous 6 months; therefore, the addition or initiation of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) may be considered for people with a recent history of a suicide attempt (Level 2) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Early improvement is often defined with a symptom scale as a reduction in score of 20% or greater from baseline (within 2 to 4 weeks after treatment initiation), whereas response is defined as 50% or greater improvement from baseline. Symptom remission is indicated by a specific threshold score for each scale, e.g., a score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), 10 or less on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and 4 or less on the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9.

We recommend the use of a validated rating scale to quantify these (see Q.5.a).

At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.',\n",

How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.a. What is Measurement-Based Care? > paragraph id: 154\\n\\nWhile MBC (Measurement-based care) is largely intended to increase clinical objectivity, it can also provide insight into patients’ subjective experiences. For example, when clinical evaluation varies substantially from patients’ symptom reporting, clinicians can use the discrepancies to explore individual factors that can colour patients’ perceptions about symptoms. These discussions are likely to inform about patients’ cognitive schemas and can enhance therapeutic rapport. Hence, scales should complement, not replace, the clinical interview and the clinician's comprehensive understanding of the patient.\\n\\nQuestion 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.a. What is Measurement-Based Care? > paragraph id: 153\\n\\nThe use of scales for MBC (Measurement-based care) is similar to the use of laboratory tests in that the results must be considered within the context of clinical assessment and care. There are many reasons why scale scores may not reflect a patient's clinical state. For example, the negative cognitive bias associated with MDD (Major depressive disorder) may interfere with accurate self-report, or some personality traits may contribute to chronic overreporting or underreporting on a symptom scale. Patients may also be concerned about over-reliance on a number and not their more complex issues.\",\n",

Clinicians often feel that using MBC (Measurement-based care) takes too much time and that discussing scales with patients takes time away from the clinical encounter. Clinicians also may perceive that scales do not capture important aspects of a clinical situation or that the act of completing scales may interfere with the therapeutic alliance. Other barriers to MBC (Measurement-based care) implementation include insufficient training on scale usage and workflows, misbeliefs about the feasibility and efficacy of MBC (Measurement-based care), challenges with language and cultural barriers to using scales, and implementation and opportunity costs associated with changing workflows.\",\n",

For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.\\n\\nQuestion 5.

What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.a. What are DHIs? > paragraph id: 130\\n\\nDigital health technologies refer broadly to the use of computers, smartphones, and tablet devices for a variety of purposes, including disease screening, monitoring, treatment, and preventing recurrence. The term also encompasses wearables such as activity trackers, digital phenotyping, text or SMS messaging, and videoconferencing for virtual care. For this guideline, we use the term, DHIs, to denote internet programs or mobile apps that deliver depression treatment.\\n\\nQuestion 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.a. What are DHIs? > paragraph id: 133\\n\\nHowever, the clinical use of DHIs also poses many challenges. Few DHIs are rigorously evaluated for efficacy and safety. Privacy and security issues are often inadequately safeguarded. User engagement with DHIs decreases over time, e.g., less than one-third of individuals with depression are still using a DHI (Digital health intervention) after 6 weeks. Access to DHIs may also be impeded by the “digital divide” or digital inequity factors, e.g., low digital literacy, inability to purchase a computer or mobile device, and lack of internet access. Hence, addressing the digital divide is important for people with MDD (Major depressive disorder). Mental health clinicians also need training in digital literacy and how to assess, recommend, and use DHIs with their patients.',\n",

What are Examples of Guided (Facilitated) DHIs? > paragraph id: 143\\n\\nThe most-studied guided DHI (Digital health intervention) approach is internet CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (iCBT). These programs offer guidance from a therapist or are intended for use by clinicians working with their patients. A recent umbrella review of iCBT described medium to large effect sizes in 4 meta-analyses (Level 1) . The Good Days Ahead program, with therapist or telephone support, was evaluated in 2 large RCTs with evidence for efficacy. Some iCBT programs (e.g., Deprexis) also incorporate chatbot agents for conversational interaction with users. Hence, guided iCBT is recommended as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression (Level 2) , and as a first-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 1) ( Table 4.3 ).\\n\\nQuestion 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 135\\n\\nWithout guidance from clinicians, patients may self-select potentially inappropriate or unsafe DHIs. Table 4.1 summarizes important questions to help clinicians evaluate DHIs for clinical use with their patients. Efficacy is the most important consideration. However, of the tens of thousands of DHIs that are commercially available, few are developed with an evidence-based framework and even fewer have undergone rigorous trials in the targeted population. In the absence of RCTs, other evidence for effectiveness may be informative, e.g., observational studies, studies in nonclinical populations, developer identity (commercial vs. health care), and alignment of features and content with evidence-based therapies.\\n\\nQuestion 4.

What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148\\n\\nMore recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 4.

A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs found a moderate positive overall effect on depressive symptoms for smartphone-based DHIs versus control conditions, but there was no significant effect in the 2 RCTs involving participants with a diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder). Given the low level of evidence, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend routine use of self-directed DHIs as monotherapy for MDD (Major depressive disorder), except in cases of mild severity when other resources are not available (Level 3) ( Table 4.3 ). Self-directed DHIs may be more useful when clinicians actively encourage patients to use and complete the program, hence, they are recommended as second-line adjunctive tools to usual clinical care when clinicians provide support and guidance (Level 3) .

What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 146\\n\\nPrior to the advent of digital interventions, certain self-help books were prescribed in RCTs to have efficacy for MDD (Major depressive disorder). Early DHIs adapted these into self-guided computer- and internet-delivered programs, which were essentially electronic self-help books providing basic psychoeducation and introducing key elements of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) or BA (Behavioural activation). An example of this approach is MoodGym, which began in 2001 as a self-directed online course and has subsequently added numerous interactive exercises and questionnaires to engage the user with the learning material.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

For example, daily mood monitoring and reminders for depression management may exacerbate depressive symptoms and heighten their salience in individuals with self-stigma or unresolved grief about their diagnosis. DHIs should include clear procedures to follow when user responses indicate severe distress, such as information on crisis lines. DHIs offering peer support may carry risks, such as the exchange of inaccurate or harmful information, interpersonal conflict, and unwanted disclosure of personal information. Some of these risks can be mitigated by features including therapist moderation of support groups, peer-developed content that can be reviewed for accuracy, and the ability to participate anonymously if desired.\\n\\nQuestion 4.

Guides may be clinically trained (e.g., a CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) therapist) or equipped with technical knowledge of the DHI (Digital health intervention) to encourage the user to complete the program (e.g., a lay coach or peer support person). Guidance can be synchronous (advice is given by the guide in real-time while the participant is using the DHI (Digital health intervention)) or asynchronous (advice is provided when it is convenient for the guide to respond, e.g., by email or text). In some cases, guidance involves specific feedback on a user's responses to homework (e.g., a thought record) generated by the DHI (Digital health intervention).

Few DHIs are rigorously evaluated for efficacy and safety. Privacy and security issues are often inadequately safeguarded. User engagement with DHIs decreases over time, e.g., less than one-third of individuals with depression are still using a DHI (Digital health intervention) after 6 weeks. Access to DHIs may also be impeded by the “digital divide” or digital inequity factors, e.g., low digital literacy, inability to purchase a computer or mobile device, and lack of internet access.

How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b.

Sequential treatment also has meta-analytic evidence for the prevention of recurrence, even when antidepressants are stopped. Adding psychotherapy (with CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) and its variations the best studied) also offers the benefits of treating residual symptoms and increasing psychological well-being and resilience. Pharmacotherapy and sequential treatment with psychotherapy are recommended especially for individuals with recurrent and severe MDEs, who carry a high risk of recurrence with monotherapy.

However, the relationship between the number of treatment sessions attended and the degree of therapeutic improvement remains unclear. Therefore, optimal doses of psychotherapy have been proposed based on the number of sessions in which at least 50% of patients respond to treatment, owing to the decreasing probability of improvement after this cut-off. The strongest evidence suggests that an optimal dose for a first-line psychotherapy, for most patients, is 12 to 16 sessions (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.d.

The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)]) initiated sequentially after treatment with an antidepressant is established (Level 1) . Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) . Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should be considered (see Q.6.d).\\n\\nQuestion 6.

Which Treatments Have New Evidence? > Psychological Treatments > paragraph id: 95\\n\\nTwo new psychological treatments have accrued enough evidence to be included as second-line or third-line treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder). First, transdiagnostic or “unified” psychological treatment of emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression, incorporates motivational enhancement, psychoeducation, training in emotional awareness, cognitive restructuring, emotion-driven behaviours (including avoidance), tolerance of physical sensations (including exposure), and relapse prevention. A positive meta-analysis supports its inclusion as a second-line treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder), which may be particularly useful in the context of concurrent anxiety issues (Level 2) ( Table 3.2 ). Second, metacognitive therapy (MCT (Metacognitive therapy)) for depression focuses on the awareness and understanding of the thoughts and feelings of oneself as well as others; this treatment is typically goal-directed and enhances metacognitive capacities to gain more flexibility in the attention, monitoring, control, and regulation of cognitive processes. The efficacy evidence in MDD (Major depressive disorder) supports MCT (Metacognitive therapy) as a third-line recommendation (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) .

At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients.

However, a Cochrane review noted that, in comparisons of acupuncture with control/sham acupuncture conditions, the effect size was smaller than clinically relevant thresholds. There is insufficient evidence for its use in more severe illness. Hence, acupuncture is recommended as a second-line treatment for mild-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder), and as a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ).\\n\\nQuestion 2.

L-methyl folate (folic acid) has meta-analytic evidence for efficacy in mild–moderate MDE (Major depressive episode), but the small effect sizes make it a second-line recommendation (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ). S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) was previously recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate MDE (Major depressive episode). Owing to mixed findings in recent RCTs, SAM-e is now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids were recommended previously as a second-line intervention for mild-severity episodes. A Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient high-quality evidence to evaluate its effects accurately, hence, omega-3 fatty acids are now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . There is modest evidence for the benefit of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in a recent meta-analysis, hence DHEA remains recommended as a third-line CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.k. Can Pharmacogenetic Testing Inform Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 114\\n\\nSeveral commercially available pharmacogenetic tests (also called pharmacogenomic tests) provide recommendations to inform the selection and dosing of antidepressants to reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions and increase the likelihood of positive responses. Currently, available tests are based on variants in genes that code for enzymes responsible for the metabolism of psychotropic medication, with some tests combining variants in genes coding for serotonin transporter and receptors. Meta-analyses show higher response and remission rates with pharmacogenetic testing compared to usual care, albeit with modest effect sizes, especially in absolute risk reductions (e.g., for response rates, ranging from 4.6 to 7.2 percentage points difference in favour of pharmacogenetic testing) (Level 2) . Moreover, the RCTs included in the meta-analyses have significant risks of bias, primarily with a lack of blinding. Hence, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend the routine use of pharmacogenetic tests, because the clinical benefits are too modest and inconsistent to justify the delay in treatment associated with obtaining the test results (Level 2) . Similarly, routine monitoring of plasma levels of antidepressants is not recommended (except perhaps for TCAs, see Box 7.1 ) because the relationship between plasma levels and clinical outcomes (response and adverse effects) is weak (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.k. Can Pharmacogenetic Testing Inform Medication Selection? > Box 7.1. > paragraph id: 115\\n\\nTricyclic Antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.\\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are efficacious treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder), but they are downgraded to second-line and third-line medications ( Table 3.3 ), respectively, because of less favourable side effect and safety profiles compared to first-line agents, and/or the need for dietary and drug restrictions (Q.3.j). Some TCAs have a more favourable side effect profile than others. For example, nortriptyline has the fewest anticholinergic and hypotensive adverse effects; it has a good safety and efficacy profile in elderly and post-stroke depression populations.\\nThese older medications continue to have an important role in managing treatment-resistant depression (TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)) and difficult-to-treat depression (DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)). TCAs have evidence for superior efficacy in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and may have specificity for subpopulations of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder), e.g., amitriptyline for comorbid painful conditions and clomipramine for comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. Another advantage of TCAs is that, in contrast to newer antidepressants, serum levels can be informative to adjust dosing. MAOIs are also efficacious in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and have a different mechanism of action compared to first-line and second-line agents. Hence, TCAs and MAOIs should be considered as therapeutic options when first-line and second-line medication treatments are not effective, with patients monitored carefully for side effects and potential for drug interactions.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91\\n\\nRegarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191\\n\\nEarly improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.\\n\\nQuestion 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164\\n\\nRoutine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 184\\n\\nThe first steps in the assessment of poor response involve re-evaluating the diagnosis (e.g., a missed diagnosis of bipolar disorder), comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. In addition to clinical reassessment, laboratory investigations should be considered to rule out potential medical factors that can contribute to persistent symptoms and that require additional interventions. Pharmacogenetic testing may be helpful to identify pharmacokinetic reasons for poor response or unusual severity of adverse effects. Systematic, sequential, and MBC (Measurement-based care) may enhance outcomes for MDD (Major depressive disorder) when initial treatments are not fully effective (Level 2) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is a Psychological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 81\\n\\nPsychotherapy is similarly effective across most demographic factors, including sex, age, level of education, culture, and ethnicity, hence these patient factors are not informative for choosing the initial psychotherapy. As for clinical factors, illness severity primarily affects the urgency with which the treatment must begin; the more severe the illness, the more imperative it is to start treatment as soon as possible to avert the risk of harm. The severity of MDE (Major depressive episode) does not predict outcomes in CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) versus pharmacotherapy; however, the combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment is more effective than either alone and should be considered in severe cases (see Q.3.b). Importantly, meta-analytic evidence suggests that CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) reduces suicide attempts by half in those who attempted suicide in the previous 6 months; therefore, the addition or initiation of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) may be considered for people with a recent history of a suicide attempt (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.f. Which Treatments Have New Evidence? > Psychological Treatments > paragraph id: 95\\n\\nTwo new psychological treatments have accrued enough evidence to be included as second-line or third-line treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder). First, transdiagnostic or “unified” psychological treatment of emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression, incorporates motivational enhancement, psychoeducation, training in emotional awareness, cognitive restructuring, emotion-driven behaviours (including avoidance), tolerance of physical sensations (including exposure), and relapse prevention. A positive meta-analysis supports its inclusion as a second-line treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder), which may be particularly useful in the context of concurrent anxiety issues (Level 2) ( Table 3.2 ). Second, metacognitive therapy (MCT (Metacognitive therapy)) for depression focuses on the awareness and understanding of the thoughts and feelings of oneself as well as others; this treatment is typically goal-directed and enhances metacognitive capacities to gain more flexibility in the attention, monitoring, control, and regulation of cognitive processes. The efficacy evidence in MDD (Major depressive disorder) supports MCT (Metacognitive therapy) as a third-line recommendation (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 171\\n\\nMaintenance psychotherapy can also prevent relapse and recurrence. Several meta-analyses and a network meta-analysis show that various psychological treatments (CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), IPT (Interpersonal therapy), CBASP (Cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy), and PST (Problem-solving therapy)) are superior to control conditions at preventing depressive relapse, with comparable effects among the different types of psychotherapy (Level 1) . Evidence also supports the use of booster sessions at regular intervals (e.g., 4 sessions over 12 months) as an effective strategy for relapse prevention with MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy). Psychotherapy appears to be as effective as antidepressants for preventing recurrence and may confer longer-lasting benefits by helping patients acquire more adaptive coping strategies over time. As a result, psychological interventions should be considered as first-choice options for mild to moderate severity MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74\\n\\nIn severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 215\\n\\nECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with response rates ranging from 65% to 75% (Level 1) . ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may be especially effective in older patients, those with psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) outweigh the risks among hospitalized MDD (Major depressive disorder) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.\\n\\nQuestion 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.d. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Selected? > paragraph id: 235\\n\\nIn some clinical situations, noninvasive neuromodulation treatments can be considered as first-choice treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder). For example, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) can be used as first-line treatment in severe illness (e.g., MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic or catatonic features, severe suicidal ideation, and deteriorating physical condition) or for patients who had a prior good response to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Similarly, rTMS can be recommended as a first-choice treatment if there are tolerability concerns with medication options or if it was effective in a previous episode. Finally, except in emergent situations as mentioned above, rTMS should generally be considered before ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), given its less invasive nature and that individuals may continue to work or attend school while undergoing rTMS. Although some studies show that prior poor response to ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is associated with poor response to rTMS, other studies do not.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

However, the relationship between the number of treatment sessions attended and the degree of therapeutic improvement remains unclear. Therefore, optimal doses of psychotherapy have been proposed based on the number of sessions in which at least 50% of patients respond to treatment, owing to the decreasing probability of improvement after this cut-off. The strongest evidence suggests that an optimal dose for a first-line psychotherapy, for most patients, is 12 to 16 sessions (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.d.

Table 3.5 summarizes comparative ratings for the first-line antidepressants in categories of efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, drug interactions (see Q.3.j), and potential discontinuation effects (see Q.6.d). These comparative ratings are based on various data sources including meta-analyses and RCTs, supplemented by expert consensus from the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) authors. Note that while ratings show those agents that have more favourable profiles and those with less favourable profiles, these are not absolute ratings; an agent can be selected for other clinical reasons despite having a rating as less favourable on a particular characteristic.\\n\\nQuestion 7.

Several studies have shown that there is no difference in outcome between switching within a medication class and switching to a different class. Hence, when switching to another antidepressant, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends first selecting a first-line antidepressant with evidence for superior efficacy and a favourable tolerability profile (Level 4) ( Table 3.5 ). Of note is that TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) and MAOI (Monoamine oxidase inhibitor) agents may be useful in the treatment algorithm if there has been a poor response to first and/or second-line antidepressants ( Box 7.1 ).\\n\\nIntroduction > paragraph id: 9\\n\\nThroughout these guidelines, all recommendations are accompanied by the level of evidence available to support each graded line of treatment. In addition, clinical support is used to rank recommendations, based on expert consensus from the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) editorial group on factors including safety, tolerability, and feasibility, where possible. A rigorous method ensures consensus among the editorial group, and new or controversial topics are highlighted to clarify the rationale for recommendations.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.k. Can Pharmacogenetic Testing Inform Medication Selection? > Box 7.1. > paragraph id: 115\\n\\nTricyclic Antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.\\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are efficacious treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder), but they are downgraded to second-line and third-line medications ( Table 3.3 ), respectively, because of less favourable side effect and safety profiles compared to first-line agents, and/or the need for dietary and drug restrictions (Q.3.j). Some TCAs have a more favourable side effect profile than others. For example, nortriptyline has the fewest anticholinergic and hypotensive adverse effects; it has a good safety and efficacy profile in elderly and post-stroke depression populations.\\nThese older medications continue to have an important role in managing treatment-resistant depression (TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)) and difficult-to-treat depression (DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)). TCAs have evidence for superior efficacy in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and may have specificity for subpopulations of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder), e.g., amitriptyline for comorbid painful conditions and clomipramine for comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder. Another advantage of TCAs is that, in contrast to newer antidepressants, serum levels can be informative to adjust dosing. MAOIs are also efficacious in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and have a different mechanism of action compared to first-line and second-line agents. Hence, TCAs and MAOIs should be considered as therapeutic options when first-line and second-line medication treatments are not effective, with patients monitored carefully for side effects and potential for drug interactions.',\n",
              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91\\n\\nRegarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.\\n\\nQuestion 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164\\n\\nRoutine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.d. What Factors are Important in Assessment and Diagnosis? > paragraph id: 40\\n\\nSimilarly, there is no supportive evidence for routine electrocardiography (ECG (Electrocardiography)), electroencephalography (EEG (Electroencephalography)), or neuroimaging in patients presenting with MDD (Major depressive disorder). These diagnostic tests should only be ordered when there are clinical indications (Level 4) . For instance, ECG (Electrocardiography) should be considered in patients with cardiovascular diseases when using medications that potentially prolong QTc interval (Level 4) . Neuroimaging should be considered in the presence of neurologic signs, new onset or persistent cognitive impairment, or sudden changes in mood, behaviour, or personality (Level 4) . In addition, neuroimaging may be recommended for patients with a new onset of late-life depression to rule out cerebral events or the onset of other structural abnormalities (e.g., tumour, metastasis) (Level 4) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 92\\n\\nTable 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 110\\n\\nSSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures and falls, particularly in older adults. Most SSRIs have few clinically relevant effects on CYP (Cytochrome P450) isoenzymes and have low risk for drug interactions. Exceptions are fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These antidepressants can increase blood levels of concurrent medications that are substrates of these CYP450 isoenzymes. Combining SSRIs with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is mitigated with the use of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, concurrent use of SSRIs with diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, especially in older adults. Mianserin and agomelatine (both not available in Canada or the USA (United States of America)) are the only antidepressants not associated with hyponatremia 7. SNRIs can cause increases in blood pressure and share the risk of interactions with NSAIDs and diuretics noted for SSRIs.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e.

What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 113\\n\\nTCAs are at higher risk of life-threatening effects in overdose, as they can lead to altered mental status, cardiac toxicity, and seizures. SSRIs should be preferentially considered for individuals with a significant risk of overdosing (Level 4) . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have the potential to cause life-threatening interactions (serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis) when combined with medications affecting monoamine metabolism (e.g., dextromethorphan-containing cough syrups, dextromethorphan-bupropion combination, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors), herbal remedies (St John's wort) or food items containing high levels of tyramine (cured meats, mature cheeses, and fermented products such as miso, kimchi, and marmite). Because of these potential interactions, MAOIs are reserved as a third-line option and should be prescribed only after providing detailed guidance on avoiding interacting medications and foods (Level 4) .\\n\\nQuestion 3.

L-methyl folate (folic acid) has meta-analytic evidence for efficacy in mild–moderate MDE (Major depressive episode), but the small effect sizes make it a second-line recommendation (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ). S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) was previously recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate MDE (Major depressive episode). Owing to mixed findings in recent RCTs, SAM-e is now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids were recommended previously as a second-line intervention for mild-severity episodes. A Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient high-quality evidence to evaluate its effects accurately, hence, omega-3 fatty acids are now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . There is modest evidence for the benefit of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in a recent meta-analysis, hence DHEA remains recommended as a third-line CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment.\\n\\nMethods > Conventions Used in This Document > paragraph id: 21\\n\\nSeveral conventions are used in these guidelines.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.f. Which Treatments Have New Evidence? > Psychological Treatments > paragraph id: 95\\n\\nTwo new psychological treatments have accrued enough evidence to be included as second-line or third-line treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder). First, transdiagnostic or “unified” psychological treatment of emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression, incorporates motivational enhancement, psychoeducation, training in emotional awareness, cognitive restructuring, emotion-driven behaviours (including avoidance), tolerance of physical sensations (including exposure), and relapse prevention. A positive meta-analysis supports its inclusion as a second-line treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder), which may be particularly useful in the context of concurrent anxiety issues (Level 2) ( Table 3.2 ). Second, metacognitive therapy (MCT (Metacognitive therapy)) for depression focuses on the awareness and understanding of the thoughts and feelings of oneself as well as others; this treatment is typically goal-directed and enhances metacognitive capacities to gain more flexibility in the attention, monitoring, control, and regulation of cognitive processes. The efficacy evidence in MDD (Major depressive disorder) supports MCT (Metacognitive therapy) as a third-line recommendation (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 171\\n\\nMaintenance psychotherapy can also prevent relapse and recurrence. Several meta-analyses and a network meta-analysis show that various psychological treatments (CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), IPT (Interpersonal therapy), CBASP (Cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy), and PST (Problem-solving therapy)) are superior to control conditions at preventing depressive relapse, with comparable effects among the different types of psychotherapy (Level 1) . Evidence also supports the use of booster sessions at regular intervals (e.g., 4 sessions over 12 months) as an effective strategy for relapse prevention with MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy). Psychotherapy appears to be as effective as antidepressants for preventing recurrence and may confer longer-lasting benefits by helping patients acquire more adaptive coping strategies over time. As a result, psychological interventions should be considered as first-choice options for mild to moderate severity MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 172\\n\\nThe sequential treatment model consists of adding or switching to psychotherapy in the maintenance phase, after a response to acute phase pharmacotherapy. Sequential treatment also has meta-analytic evidence for the prevention of recurrence, even when antidepressants are stopped. Adding psychotherapy (with CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) and its variations the best studied) also offers the benefits of treating residual symptoms and increasing psychological well-being and resilience. Pharmacotherapy and sequential treatment with psychotherapy are recommended especially for individuals with recurrent and severe MDEs, who carry a high risk of recurrence with monotherapy. For these cases, pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychotherapy treatment (Level 1) ( Table 6.1 ).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.l. Can Other Biomarkers Inform Treatment Selection? > paragraph id: 118\\n\\nOther biomarkers with evidence of a reproducible predictive effect include EEG (Electroencephalography) measures of brain activity. For example, stronger loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potentials is associated with a better response to SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Given the early state of evidence, modest effect size, lack of evidence of better response with alternative treatments, and the need for specialized equipment, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend routine use of EEG (Electroencephalography) for selecting initial treatment for depression (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.l. Can Other Biomarkers Inform Treatment Selection? > paragraph id: 117\\n\\nA biomarker is an objective measure of any substance, structure, or process in the body or its products that may influence or predict a disease, prognosis, or treatment outcome. Biomarkers such as plasma levels of specific proteins, imaging or electrophysiological measures of brain function have been examined as potential indicators to predict which treatment may work for which person. Inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood and electrophysiological measures of brain function have shown consistent associations with antidepressant treatment outcomes. For example, increased levels of interleukin 8 and the C-reactive protein have been associated with worse responses to SSRIs. Because of the small effect size of these associations, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend measuring these biomarkers for routine antidepressant selection (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.d. What Factors are Important in Assessment and Diagnosis? > paragraph id: 40\\n\\nSimilarly, there is no supportive evidence for routine electrocardiography (ECG (Electrocardiography)), electroencephalography (EEG (Electroencephalography)), or neuroimaging in patients presenting with MDD (Major depressive disorder). These diagnostic tests should only be ordered when there are clinical indications (Level 4) . For instance, ECG (Electrocardiography) should be considered in patients with cardiovascular diseases when using medications that potentially prolong QTc interval (Level 4) . Neuroimaging should be considered in the presence of neurologic signs, new onset or persistent cognitive impairment, or sudden changes in mood, behaviour, or personality (Level 4) . In addition, neuroimaging may be recommended for patients with a new onset of late-life depression to rule out cerebral events or the onset of other structural abnormalities (e.g., tumour, metastasis) (Level 4) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 119\\n\\nCAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here we provide recommendations for using the CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments that have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment has reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) therefore recommends the consideration of CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments alone only for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.e. What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? > paragraph id: 195\\n\\nThe drawbacks of adjunctive treatments include the possibility of additive side effects, increased cost of treatment, and potential for drug–drug interactions (Level 4) . Furthermore, using multiple medications may contribute to decreased adherence to treatment (Level 4) . It should be noted, however, that adding an adjunctive agent at a low dose may accrue fewer side effects than increasing a single medication to higher doses (Level 3) . Finally, there is little evidence available for maintenance treatment with adjunctive agents, so it is unclear how long adjunctive medications should be continued.\\n\\nMethods > Caveats and Limitations > paragraph id: 19\\n\\nEvaluation of many treatments and complex interventions also pose challenges due to lack of blinding and choice of comparison conditions. For example, studies comparing psychological treatments to minimal control conditions (such as waitlist) may not be as clinically relevant as studies that compare novel treatments to standard or usual care. Further, RCTs may have limited generalizability due to restrictive inclusion criteria. Accordingly, evidence from observational studies can complement controlled trials and is used where appropriate. Finally, while meta-analyses can track the evolution of evidence over time, it is recognized that early investigations of novel treatments tend to show larger effect sizes that decrease over subsequent years, particularly when the novel treatment becomes standard care. Given the rapid pace of research, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) will review these guidelines again in 7 years (2030).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How are Comorbid Conditions Managed? > paragraph id: 128\\n\\nThe CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines cited evidence that the presence of any personality disorder with MDD (Major depressive disorder) reduced the benefit of psychotherapy. Recent evidence from higher-quality studies, focusing on CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), no longer supports this finding. Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (16 to 20 sessions) is recommended for patients with depression and concurrent personality disorder (Level 2) . Evidence continues to support the use of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) for MDD (Major depressive disorder) with concurrent anxiety, substance use, or ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) (Level 2) . CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) of greater complexity (i.e., including therapeutic components of BA (Behavioural activation) and cognitive restructuring) should be considered with psychiatric comorbidities.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.c. How is a Psychological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 78\\n\\nConsistent with the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines, recent evidence continues to support CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), interpersonal therapy (IPT (Interpersonal therapy)), and BA (Behavioural activation) as first-line recommended psychological treatments for the acute treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 1) ( Table 3.2 ). Notably, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) appears to be efficacious across formats including individual, group, and telephone/digital delivery (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 75\\n\\nCombining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment; combined treatment also is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)]) initiated sequentially after treatment with an antidepressant is established (Level 1) . Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) . Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should be considered (see Q.6.d).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .\\n\\nMethods > Caveats and Limitations > paragraph id: 20\\n\\nIn summary, owing to the variability of individual patient cases and limitations of the evidence base, few definitive or universally preferred treatments apply to all patients. Therefore, these CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations should be viewed as guidance for clinicians to consider within the context of each patient, rather than as established standards of care. Finally, since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines have a global reach and the evidence base is not country-specific, we note that some recommended treatments are not available in Canada and that regulatory requirements for medications vary from country to country.\\n\\nQuestion 3.

How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 70\\n\\nThe choice of initial treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) is an important and consequential decision that should be made collaboratively between clinician and patient. Information sharing should include the range of potential treatments, the evidence supporting each, the nature and severity of depression, and the personal situation, expectations, and preferences of the patient. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations are based primarily on the severity of depression (see Conventions section for definitions of mild, moderate, and severe), but other factors, including treatment response in past episodes, patient preference and treatment availability, should also be considered ( Table 3.1 ).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 100\\n\\nThe DSM-5-TR mixed features specifier describes an MDE (Major depressive episode) presenting with both depressive symptoms and subsyndromal manic symptoms. It may be challenging to differentiate MDD (Major depressive disorder) with mixed features from mixed states found in bipolar disorders, hence, patients manifesting mixed symptoms should be managed in consultation with a psychiatrist (Level 3) . Owing to the short history of the mixed features specifier for MDD (Major depressive disorder), there is minimal RCT (Randomized controlled trial) evidence for treatment. Given this paucity of data, first-line antidepressants are still recommended for MDE (Major depressive episode) with mixed features ( Table 3.6 ). However, close monitoring for activating side effects (e.g., agitation and increase in suicidal ideation), and potential manic/hypomanic switch, is recommended when initiating antidepressants (Level 3) . The serotonin-dopamine activity modulator, lurasidone, is recommended as a second-line agent for patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) and mixed features because of an RCT (Randomized controlled trial) showing efficacy compared to placebo (Level 2) .\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.n. How are Comorbid Conditions Managed? > paragraph id: 124\\n\\nComorbidity with psychiatric and other medical conditions is common in MDD (Major depressive disorder). For example, high rates of psychiatric comorbidity (10% to 30% for many disorders, e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity [ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder)] disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders; and 40% to 60% for anxiety disorders) are reported in patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder). Similarly, rates of comorbid MDD (Major depressive disorder) are high (10% to 30%) in patients with nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic pain, among others. The bidirectional nature of the relationships between depression and many medical conditions underscores the importance of recognizing and treating comorbidities with MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

It should be noted that purchase cost is only a small part of the overall cost of treatment, which includes both direct and indirect costs of care. Generic medications are approved based on demonstrating “bioequivalency” to the reference brand-name product. Differences in bioavailability between generic and brand-name medication are reported, especially for extended-release formulations. However, there are no meta-analyses or clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of generic and brand-name antidepressants.

The main objectives of the acute phase of treatment are to address patient safety and select evidence-based treatments to improve symptom severity and functioning. Remission of symptoms, defined as the resolution or near-resolution of symptoms (operationalized using validated rating scales, see Q.5.b), is an important target of acute treatment (see Q.2.b). Specific actions and activities of the acute phase are listed in Table 2.1 . Psychoeducation and self-management are integral to MDD (Major depressive disorder) management (Level 2) . Psychoeducation refers to knowledge and information about the symptoms, coping strategies and treatment options for depression, whereas self-management uses techniques (e.g., problem-solving, lifestyle changes, and behavioural activation [BA (Behavioural activation)]) to empower patients to actively manage their illness and live well.

Sequential treatment also has meta-analytic evidence for the prevention of recurrence, even when antidepressants are stopped. Adding psychotherapy (with CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) and its variations the best studied) also offers the benefits of treating residual symptoms and increasing psychological well-being and resilience. Pharmacotherapy and sequential treatment with psychotherapy are recommended especially for individuals with recurrent and severe MDEs, who carry a high risk of recurrence with monotherapy.

Why is Symptom Remission Important? > paragraph id: 49\\n\\nSymptom remission remains a crucial clinical target for acute treatment, as substantial evidence supports a lower risk of relapse in those who achieve remission compared with those who do not (Level 2) . In contrast, failure to achieve remission is associated with continuing symptom burden and poor functional outcomes. Evidence supports symptomatic remission as a realistic goal of acute phase treatment for most patients both in psychiatric and primary care settings. However, in defining remission and recovery, patients often regard aspects of functioning and quality of life as more important than the absence of symptoms. Hence, symptom remission, while important, should be considered only an intermediate objective for optimal treatment outcomes.\\n\\nQuestion 2.

Why is Symptom Remission Important? > paragraph id: 51\\n\\nFinally, some patients, such as those with PDD (Persistent depressive disorder), may not achieve symptom remission despite treatment with several evidence-based approaches. For these patients with DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression), the therapeutic focus should shift away from symptom remission towards prioritizing the best possible improvement in functioning and quality of life (see Q.7.b).\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180\\n\\nIn real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.e. What are Diagnostic Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions? > paragraph id: 42\\n\\nFinally, about 20% to 30% of individuals with MDEs have a chronic course lasting more than 2 years. In DSM-5-TR, a chronic MDE (Major depressive episode) (with full criteria) is classified as a specifier of persistent depressive disorder (PDD (Persistent depressive disorder)), which is characterized by 2 or more depressive symptoms that are present for more than 2 years. MDE (Major depressive episode) in partial remission after treatment is a separate PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) specifier. PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) specifiers also include dysthymia, which is a chronic course of subthreshold depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for MDE (Major depressive episode). This conflation of chronic MDE (Major depressive episode), partial remission MDE (Major depressive episode), and dysthymia makes it difficult to differentiate specific treatments for PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) (see Q.3.f). Regardless, compared to individuals with episodic MDEs, those with PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) show lower response rates to standard treatments and less likelihood of achieving remission. Management for PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) should employ the DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) framework, with the focus of treatment centred on improving quality of life and functioning instead of symptom remission (Level 4) (see Q.7.b).\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168\\n\\nOnce patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

SDM (Shared decision-making) helps establish a strong therapeutic alliance which facilitates psychoeducation about critical aspects of the treatment, including achieving symptom remission and promoting long-term mental wellness. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of the broad range of treatment options available for MDD (Major depressive disorder), including lifestyle changes and self-management, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine)) treatments. Clinicians also should explain how treatments work and dispel myths and stigma (e.g., related to medications or role of stress).

Cost may also play a role in medication treatments, given that, in general, newer medications are more expensive than those for which generic formulations are available.

While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT (Randomized controlled trial) methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD (Major depressive disorder), with medium to large effects (Level 1) . Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40\\u2005min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Table 2.4 and Table 3.7).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Light therapy is a chronobiological intervention in which a device delivers timed exposure to supplemental bright light. A typical protocol for light therapy uses 10,000 lux fluorescent white light for 30\\u2005min daily in the morning, shortly after awakening. Light therapy continues to be recommended as first-line monotherapy for seasonal (winter) depression (seasonal pattern course specifier in DSM-5-TR) with several consistent supportive meta-analyses (Level 1) . Despite some heterogeneity, recent meta-analyses also find efficacy for light therapy in nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) , with larger effects when light therapy is combined with antidepressants.

In contrast, there are few interventional studies of diet manipulation. There is only 1 RCT (Randomized controlled trial) showing a modest effect of a Mediterranean-type diet in adults with MDD (Major depressive disorder), supporting a third-line recommendation (Level 3) ( Table 2.4 ).

S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) was previously recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate MDE (Major depressive episode). Owing to mixed findings in recent RCTs, SAM-e is now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids were recommended previously as a second-line intervention for mild-severity episodes. A Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient high-quality evidence to evaluate its effects accurately, hence, omega-3 fatty acids are now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . There is modest evidence for the benefit of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in a recent meta-analysis, hence DHEA remains recommended as a third-line CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment.\\n\\nQuestion 2.

How and Who Should Be Screened for Depression? > paragraph id: 33\\n\\nMajor extant guidelines provide conflicting recommendations regarding routine screening for depression in adults who appear at average risk (i.e., with no apparent symptoms of depression or risk factors), in part because of inconsistent evidence to support the benefits of screening and the challenges and costs of implementation. For example, the 2013 Canadian Task Force for Preventative Health recommended against routine depression screening for adults with average risk, although this was graded as a weak recommendation because of low-quality evidence. The CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines recommended screening for individuals with risk factors when resources were available for further assessment and treatment. The United States Preventative Services Task Force recently updated its evidence review and concluded that routine depression screening is associated with moderate net benefit and improved outcomes after 6 to 12 months, particularly in settings that provide additional interventions for those who screen positive (Level 2) . There are potential risks to routine screening, e.g., stigmatization, impact on occupational or insurance status, and unnecessary psychological and/or pharmacological treatment for false-positive screens, but the prevalence and impact of these risks have not been rigorously evaluated.\\n\\nQuestion 1.

What Factors are Important in Assessment and Diagnosis? > paragraph id: 37\\n\\nA comprehensive diagnostic assessment is the first step in the clinical management of MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 4) ( Figure 1.1 ). Since MDD (Major depressive disorder) is a heterogeneous condition with a myriad of symptoms and presentations, a personalized assessment incorporating a diagnostic framework, such as DSM-5 or International Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD (International Classification of Diseases)-11), allows exploration of individual differences. A comprehensive assessment should assess emotional, cognitive, and somatic symptoms, as well as vulnerability and resiliency factors across the life span, supplemented by collateral information whenever possible, and recognize ethnocultural diversity ( Table 1.2 ). A history of childhood maltreatment and/or stressful/traumatic experiences is not always volunteered, so these should be explored sensitively during an assessment. The differential diagnosis should include psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical conditions that present with depressive symptoms, while recognizing that these conditions may also be comorbid with MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.d. What Factors are Important in Assessment and Diagnosis? > paragraph id: 39\\n\\nGiven the close relationships between MDD (Major depressive disorder) and other medical illnesses, a medical workup (including a detailed medical history and targeted physical examination) is important to rule out nonpsychiatric medical conditions. Although there is little direct evidence to support routine bloodwork, a complete blood count (CBC) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are low-cost blood tests that can help rule out anaemia and thyroid dysfunction as treatable causes of low mood and energy (Level 3) . Other laboratory tests should be considered only when history and examination suggest other medical conditions in the differential diagnosis (e.g., testosterone or vitamin D deficiency) or in patients with other medical comorbidities, substance use disorders, older adults, or individuals with self-neglect and impaired judgment or communication (Level 4) .\\n\\nQuestion 1.

              " 'Question 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.e. What are Diagnostic Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions? > paragraph id: 41\\n\\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) includes subtypes within an MDE (Major depressive episode). These are classified as episode specifiers, based on cross-sectional symptoms of an MDE (Major depressive episode), and course specifiers, based on the longitudinal pattern of MDEs. Several episode specifiers (melancholic, atypical, psychotic, and catatonic features) are held over from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), while others (anxious distress and mixed features) are new in DSM-5-TR. Course specifiers include seasonal pattern (with primarily a winter pattern of MDEs) and peripartum onset. Specifiers are primarily useful for describing symptom and course patterns, with some utility for prognosis. However, they generally have limited value for selecting treatment (except for psychotic features and seasonal pattern, see Q.3.g and Q.3.m). Other clinical dimensions not identified in DSM-5-TR may be more useful for guiding treatment selection, including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, somatic symptoms (e.g., pain, energy, and fatigue), and anhedonia (see Q.3.f).\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.e. What are Diagnostic Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions? > paragraph id: 42\\n\\nFinally, about 20% to 30% of individuals with MDEs have a chronic course lasting more than 2 years. In DSM-5-TR, a chronic MDE (Major depressive episode) (with full criteria) is classified as a specifier of persistent depressive disorder (PDD (Persistent depressive disorder)), which is characterized by 2 or more depressive symptoms that are present for more than 2 years. MDE (Major depressive episode) in partial remission after treatment is a separate PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) specifier. PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) specifiers also include dysthymia, which is a chronic course of subthreshold depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for MDE (Major depressive episode). This conflation of chronic MDE (Major depressive episode), partial remission MDE (Major depressive episode), and dysthymia makes it difficult to differentiate specific treatments for PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) (see Q.3.f). Regardless, compared to individuals with episodic MDEs, those with PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) show lower response rates to standard treatments and less likelihood of achieving remission. Management for PDD (Persistent depressive disorder) should employ the DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) framework, with the focus of treatment centred on improving quality of life and functioning instead of symptom remission (Level 4) (see Q.7.b).\\n\\nMethods > Conventions Used in This Document > paragraph id: 22\\n\\nWhile various terms are used for lived experience, in these guidelines, the term patient refers to individuals with MDD (Major depressive disorder) in clinical treatment. We use the terms mild , moderate , and severe to describe the severity of a major depressive episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)), based on the rating of symptom severity and degree of functional impairment, whichever is higher. We recommend the use of a validated rating scale to quantify these (see Q.5.a). As an example, an MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity could represent either moderately severe symptoms with mild–moderate functional impairment, or mild–moderate symptom severity with moderate impairment.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How can Access for Equity Deserving Groups be Improved? > paragraph id: 44\\n\\nScreening is underutilized in equity-deserving groups despite the availability of validated screening tools in many different languages and formats. Encouraging and training primary care providers to routinely screen for depression in equity-deserving groups using validated scales (e.g., the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire), available in many languages, and Q.1.c) increases access to mental health services, referrals, and treatment. Culturally competent care, in which a patient's sociocultural and language needs are explicitly addressed, is shown to improve psychiatric care and outcomes. Trauma-informed approaches should be used where indicated, e.g., for patients who are Indigenous, to account for the influence of transgenerational and other traumas on assessment and management (Level 4) . Training mental health professionals in cultural competency, trauma-informed care, healthcare disparities and personal bias also improves care and access for equity-deserving groups. Collaborative care, a healthcare delivery system comprised of case managers alongside primary care providers and mental health specialists (see Q.2.g), may be particularly effective for patients from equity-deserving groups and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds (Level 3) .\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.f. How can Access for Equity Deserving Groups be Improved? > paragraph id: 43\\n\\nCompared to the general population, the prevalence of MDD (Major depressive disorder) is higher in racialized, indigenous, gender minority, and certain religious populations. There is also a recognized lack of access and underutilization of mental health services for equity-deserving groups. The most common barriers to care include costs of treatment, cultural beliefs, stigma, language barriers, fear of being judged by the care provider, unequal geographic distribution of services, and fragmented health services. Some approaches to help overcome these barriers and reduce the existing gap in access to services include screening programs, incorporating culturally competent and collaborative care, and using digital health interventions (DHIs) tailored for equity-deserving groups ( Table 1.2 ).\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.f. How can Access for Equity Deserving Groups be Improved? > paragraph id: 45\\n\\nFinally, telehealth and DHIs (see Q.4) may also provide benefits for equity-deserving groups, as they can address language, stigma, and geographic disparities in service. Systematic reviews have shown that telehealth, delivered in the patient's preferred language with cultural adaptation and cultural matching of patients and providers, improves health outcomes and access to services (Level 3) . Other studies show that DHIs are promising resources to enhance screening and service delivery. However, challenges with digital literacy and technology costs are barriers to the scale-up of digital services for many patients (see Q.4.b).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g.

Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected? > paragraph id: 196\\n\\nSelecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the adjunctive agent ( Table 7.2 ) and the continued antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.\\n\\nQuestion 6.

The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) .

What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 123\\n\\nAcupuncture has also been studied in depression, with several meta-analyses showing the efficacy of acupuncture, as monotherapy and as an adjunct to antidepressants, versus all control conditions. However, a Cochrane review noted that, in comparisons of acupuncture with control/sham acupuncture conditions, the effect size was smaller than clinically relevant thresholds. There is insufficient evidence for its use in more severe illness. Hence, acupuncture is recommended as a second-line treatment for mild-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder), and as a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ).\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 119\\n\\nCAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here we provide recommendations for using the CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments that have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment has reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) therefore recommends the consideration of CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments alone only for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.\\n\\nQuestion 3.

Another meta-analysis on the efficacy of lavender reported a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions. However, given the modest benefit and the major limitations of the RCTs, saffron, lavender, and roseroot continue to be recommended as third-line treatments in mild illness (Level 3) ( Table 3.7 ).\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 70\\n\\nThe choice of initial treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) is an important and consequential decision that should be made collaboratively between clinician and patient. Information sharing should include the range of potential treatments, the evidence supporting each, the nature and severity of depression, and the personal situation, expectations, and preferences of the patient. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations are based primarily on the severity of depression (see Conventions section for definitions of mild, moderate, and severe), but other factors, including treatment response in past episodes, patient preference and treatment availability, should also be considered ( Table 3.1 ).\\n\\nMethods > Conventions Used in This Document > paragraph id: 22\\n\\nWhile various terms are used for lived experience, in these guidelines, the term patient refers to individuals with MDD (Major depressive disorder) in clinical treatment. We use the terms mild , moderate , and severe to describe the severity of a major depressive episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)), based on the rating of symptom severity and degree of functional impairment, whichever is higher. We recommend the use of a validated rating scale to quantify these (see Q.5.a). As an example, an MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity could represent either moderately severe symptoms with mild–moderate functional impairment, or mild–moderate symptom severity with moderate impairment.\\n\\nQuestion 3.

For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected? > paragraph id: 196\\n\\nSelecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the adjunctive agent ( Table 7.2 ) and the continued antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.e. What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? > paragraph id: 194\\n\\nAdding an adjunctive agent retains partial treatment gains from the initial antidepressant, avoids discontinuation symptoms from stopping the first medication, and potentially adds complementary mechanisms of action that have a faster onset of response. These benefits are especially helpful when there has been a partial response to the first antidepressant, and it is well tolerated. Adding another medication may also target specific residual symptoms or side effects from the initial antidepressant.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c.

How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175\\n\\nUp to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177\\n\\nIt is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176\\n\\nProtracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.\\nPersistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.\\nIt has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10\\u2005mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.',\n",

Are Antidepressants Associated With an Increased Risk of Suicide? > paragraph id: 105\\n\\nIn summary, the initial few weeks before and after starting any treatment is a higher risk period for suicide. While antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small proportion of patients may experience increased suicidal ideation when initiating antidepressants, especially young people. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends routine monitoring of suicide risk for all patients during antidepressant treatment, with enhanced attention during the first 4 weeks following a new antidepressant prescription and after stopping the medication (Level 3) . With adolescent and young adult patients, in particular, clinicians should ensure that they are aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviours before initiating an antidepressant. Clinicians also should educate patients that if they experience an increase in suicidal thoughts when starting a new medication, they should (a) understand them as a medication side effect; (b) be aware that increasing suicidal thoughts indicate a need for urgent action to address distress and other symptoms; (c) implement a safety plan (see Q.2.c); and (d) reach out to their care provider, crisis line (e.g., call 9-8-8 in Canada and the USA (United States of America)), or an emergency department (Level 4) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.\\nIt has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10\\u2005mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.',\n",

Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170\\n\\nThe 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).\\n\\nQuestion 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173\\n\\nWhile 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164\\n\\nRoutine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.\\n\\nQuestion 5.

What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 111\\n\\nA rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 109\\n\\nMost first-line antidepressants have a well-established safety record and can be combined with other commonly prescribed medications without significant risk of interactions (summarized in Table 3.4 ). Here, we highlight exceptions to this rule and cases where caution is warranted.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 92\\n\\nTable 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 72\\n\\nFor MDE (Major depressive episode) with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 190\\n\\nFor these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188\\n\\nAfter optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.\\n\\nQuestion 3.

Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

What are the Risk Factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder)? > Dynamic, Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors > paragraph id: 31\\n\\nStressful life events and circumstances, including interpersonal stress, job strain and insecurity, income inequality, and challenging living environment, are associated with an increased risk of developing MDD (Major depressive disorder) even when correcting for pre-existing depressive symptoms and comorbid other medical conditions. Bereavement is a normal process, but severe or prolonged grief also can increase the risk of an MDE (Major depressive episode). Other modifiable factors associated with a greater risk of MDD (Major depressive disorder) include a sedentary lifestyle, increased screen time watching television or using mobile devices, and shift work.\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.a. What are the Risk Factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder)? > paragraph id: 26\\n\\nNumerous risk factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder) have been identified, with varying strength of evidence ( Table 1.1 ). Some are static and nonmodifiable historical factors such as a family history of depression and a history of adverse childhood experiences. Others are dynamic in that they may emerge and recede through the life span, such as psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical illness, interpersonal or occupational stress, and bereavement. Clinicians should be aware of both static and dynamic factors to better address the full range of biological, psychological and social issues in case management ( Table 1.2 ).\\n\\nQuestion 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.a. What are the Risk Factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder)? > Dynamic, Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors > paragraph id: 29\\n\\nMany nonpsychiatric medical conditions, including chronic pain, cardiovascular illness, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes mellitus, sleep disorders, obesity, and acne, are associated with increased risk for MDD (Major depressive disorder), with most conditions having a bidirectional relationship. Periods of hormonal changes in women, e.g., perinatal and perimenopausal periods, are also high-risk times for MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 1.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 75\\n\\nCombining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment; combined treatment also is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)]) initiated sequentially after treatment with an antidepressant is established (Level 1) . Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) . Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should be considered (see Q.6.d).\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 76\\n\\nPlanned sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after initial response to pharmacotherapy) may be especially useful for individuals with recurrent and severe forms of depression who carry a high risk of relapse following a monotherapy treatment (Level 2) (see Q.6.b). In these cases, pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychological treatment.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.d. How Many Sessions of Psychological Treatment are Required? > paragraph id: 83\\n\\nThe frequency of treatment sessions is also related to patient benefit, with increased frequency of psychological treatment sessions producing better outcomes. Twice-weekly sessions for CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) and IPT (Interpersonal therapy) for depression show improved outcomes compared to once-weekly sessions (Level 2) . There is little support for the efficacy of psychological treatment delivered less than once per week.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 111\\n\\nA rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 110\\n\\nSSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures and falls, particularly in older adults. Most SSRIs have few clinically relevant effects on CYP (Cytochrome P450) isoenzymes and have low risk for drug interactions. Exceptions are fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These antidepressants can increase blood levels of concurrent medications that are substrates of these CYP450 isoenzymes. Combining SSRIs with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is mitigated with the use of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, concurrent use of SSRIs with diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, especially in older adults. Mianserin and agomelatine (both not available in Canada or the USA (United States of America)) are the only antidepressants not associated with hyponatremia 7. SNRIs can cause increases in blood pressure and share the risk of interactions with NSAIDs and diuretics noted for SSRIs.\\n\\nQuestion 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 93\\n\\nIn addition to efficacy and tolerability, patient and clinical factors may also be considered in selecting antidepressant medication in some cases, including episode specifiers and symptom dimensions (see Q.3.g). While most antidepressants appear to be effective irrespective of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline severity, age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. For patients over age 65, SSRIs may be less effective and SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may be more effective (Level 3) . For young patients up to age 25, the balance of efficacy, adverse reactions and risk of discontinuation symptoms may favour using fluoxetine or agomelatine over other antidepressants (Level 4) .\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

              " 'Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138\\n\\nAccess, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.\\n\\nQuestion 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148\\n\\nMore recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).\\n\\nQuestion 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 134\\n\\nMany individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191\\n\\nEarly improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187\\n\\nOptimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50\\u2005mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.\\n\\nQuestion 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188\\n\\nAfter optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

Comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with poor treatment response include anxiety disorders, ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Comorbid nonpsychiatric medical conditions may also be associated with poor response to antidepressants. For example, undiagnosed sleep apnea may be an important contributor to persistent residual symptoms of insomnia, fatigue, and low motivation. Clinicians should also be aware that comorbid conditions do not remain static over time. Hence, regular reassessment is important for patients with persistent symptoms.\\n\\nMethods > Grading of Recommendations > Table A. > paragraph id: 14\\n\\nTable A.

However, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and the results were graded as low quality due to the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3).\\n* **Recommendation:** Based on the available evidence, there is currently **insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD**.\\n* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384)\\n* **Important Considerations:**\\n  + Many individuals with depression face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs.\\n  + Commercially available DHIs for depression often prioritize popularity and fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information.\\n  + Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation.\\n* **Medications:** No **medications** are recommended in the context of AI apps for depression.',\n",
              " '* To determine if an **antidepressant** is working, look for early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting the **antidepressant**.\\n* If early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the **antidepressant** if there are tolerability concerns.\\n* Optimizing the **antidepressant** dose is an important first step, with higher than minimal therapeutic doses being more effective, but less well-tolerated.\\n* After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another **antidepressant** or adding an adjunctive medication, such as **fluoxetine**.\\n* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9D-07067437241245384) and [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384) provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of depression, including the use of **antidepressants**. \\n\\nNote: The evidence for the efficacy of switching **antidepressants** is inconsistent, and meta-analyses show that switching to another **antidepressant** is not superior to continuing the same one.',\n",
              " '* **Medication Recommendation:** \\n    + Patients who have achieved symptom remission should continue **antidepressant** medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.\\n    + Patients with risk factors for recurrence should continue **antidepressant** treatment for 2 years or more.\\n* **Treatment Considerations:**\\n    + Maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.\\n    + Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.\\n* **Patient-Specific Factors:**\\n    + Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should be considered for longer-term **antidepressant** treatment.\\n* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384) \\n    + The 2016 CANMAT guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with **antidepressants** for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. \\n    + New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1). \\n* **Tapering **antidepressant****: \\n    + When a decision is made to stop the **antidepressant**, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.\\n    + For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the **antidepressant** can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.',\n",
              " \"* **Next Steps for Non-Response to **Escitalopram****: \\n    + The first step is to optimize the antidepressant dose. Since the patient is currently on **escitalopram** at 10 mg, increasing the dose could be considered, balancing the potential for increased efficacy against the risk of increased side effects and poorer adherence.\\n    + It's essential to assess the patient for factors that may contribute to poor response, including clinical factors (e.g., incorrect diagnosis, demographic and illness characteristics), psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical comorbidities, acute or chronic stressors, and treatment factors (e.g., inadequate duration of treatment, side effects, poor adherence, pharmacogenetic variability).\\n* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384) suggest that higher than minimal therapeutic doses of antidepressants are more effective, up to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of **fluoxetine**.\\n* **Considerations:**\\n    + Regular reassessment of the patient is crucial, as comorbid conditions may change over time.\\n    + Undiagnosed or untreated comorbid conditions, such as anxiety disorders, sleep apnea, or substance use disorders, may contribute to poor response and should be addressed.\\n    + The decision to increase the dose or switch to a different antidepressant should be based on the individual patient's response, tolerance, and clinical context.\\n* **Level of Evidence:** The recommendation to optimize the antidepressant dose is based on **Level 1** evidence, which includes high-quality meta-analyses with narrow confidence intervals and/or two or more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with adequate sample size.\\n* **Reference:** [Table A. CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384) provides the criteria for grading the level of evidence.\",\n",
              " '* **Medication Considerations for ECT:**\\n  + Generally, **antidepressants** and other medications can be continued during ECT treatment (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384].\\n  + Some medications may interfere with ECT efficacy or worsen cognitive side effects and should be discontinued or held before ECT, including:\\n    - **Benzodiazepines**\\n    - **Anticonvulsant medications**\\n    - **Lithium** (may worsen cognitive side effects)\\n    - **Cannabis** (may worsen cognitive side effects)\\n* **Reasoning:** The decision to continue or discontinue medications during ECT should be made on a patient-specific basis, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of each medication.\\n* **Important Note:** The use of **ketamine** has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT, whether as an anaesthetic agent or with single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT.']"
