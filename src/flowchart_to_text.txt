**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD
